Can all lead to problems like this--or it could be the sign of something worse.  May sure to inform your healthcare provider of any medications, over the counter or prescription you are taking along with any vitamins and supplements.
If you cannot afford to your to your healthcare provider/do not have insurance contact your local Planned Parenthood, reproductive clinic, or free clinic.  They should be able to help you for free/reduced cost or with a sliding fee scale based on income.  If they are unable to help you they should be able to refer you to someone who can."

I'm a girl and i was wondering could i be pregnant because me and my girlfriend had sex and I've been craving food I don't usually eat and my stomach hurts really bad and I've been having mood swings. Thoughts?,"Uhhh. I'm sorry, you're a girl having sex with another girl and you're worried that you might be pregnant??
I don't think you're ready to be having any sex until you understand the basics of human biology. How old are you???"
,"First of all I will suggest you to take pregnancy test . It very easy go to any medicine store [ pharmacy] and buy a pregnancy test gadget and test own your own. There must be a manual guide to learn more how to use .
And second as you said you're a girl and you had sex with your girlfriend that's mean she is girl too. So there is no possibility to get pregnant . Why there is no chance ? Because an pregnancy ussaly happened after a sex with a male . Becuase
Getting pregnant (conception) happens when a man’s sperm fertilises a woman’s egg. Read more
So I think there is no chance .
If you feel sick you must take some medicine and for sure must visit a doctor . I think its your health disorder there is nothing to do having sex with your gf and those are not a pregnancy symptoms."

,"Essay writing structure
Composing an academic essay entails fashioning a coherent pair of ideas to a debate. Due to the fact essays are essentially linear--they feature one idea at a period--they should show their thoughts in the arrangement which makes most sense into an individual reader. Properly structuring an essay signifies attending into a reader's logic.
The focus of this kind of essay predicts its arrangement. It dictates that the advice readers will need to know and the arrangement where they will need to receive it. So your article's structure is fundamentally unique for the most important claim you're earning. Although you can find guidelines for building certain traditional essay types (e.g., comparative analysis), there are no set system.
Answering Inquiries: The Sections of a Essay
A common article has various sorts of advice, frequently situated in technical components or segments. Even limited essays function a number of different surgeries: Introducing the debate, analyzing data, increasing counter-arguments, concluding. Introductions and decisions have mended places, however, other parts do not. Counterargument, for example, can happen within just a paragraph, either being a freestanding segment, as part of the onset, or even before the end. Background materials (historical context or biographical info, a summary of appropriate criticism or theory, this is of a essential term) usually appears in the beginning of the essay, between your debut and also the first analytical department, but may possibly also appear near the start of the specific portion to which it truly is related.
It is helpful to consider about those different essay segments as answering a succession of questions that your reader might ask when restricting your thesis. (Readers have to have queries. Should they don't, the thesis is the most likely only an observation of reality, maybe not an arguable claim.)
""What?"" The very first question to anticipate from your reader would be ""what"": What signs proves the phenomenon clarified by your thesis is true? To answer this question you must examine your evidence, so demonstrating the truth of one's claim. This really ""exactly what"" or ""demonstration"" part includes early in this essay, often shortly after this debut. As you're in essence reporting exactly what you've seen, here could be the area you've got to say about when you begin producing. But you have to be forewarned: It willn't take up much more compared to a third (usually much less) of the finished essay. Should it, the article may lack equilibrium and could see as mere summary or description.
""How?"" A reader may also desire to understand if the claims of this thesis are authentic in all situations. The corresponding challenge would be ""how"": Just how can the thesis stand until the challenge of a counterargument? Exactly how does the introduction of new stuff--a brand new direction of looking at the signs, yet another set of sources--affect that the claims you are making? On average, an article will probably comprise atleast ""how"" area. (phone it ""complication"" as you're responding to a reader's complicating questions) This section usually arrives after the ""what,"" but keep in your mind that an article may reevaluate its debate a couple times depending on its span, and that counter argument alone could appear almost everywhere within a essay.
Your writer will also want to know what is at stake on your claim: Why can your interpretation of the phenomenon thing to anybody beside you personally? This question covers the larger consequences of one's thesis. It enables your audience to comprehend your own essay in just a bigger context. In answering ""why"", your essay explains a unique significance. Although you could gesture in this question in the introduction, the fullest reply to this comes at your essay's conclude. If you abandon it out, your subscribers may experience your essay too incomplete--or worse, even as moot or insular.
Mapping an Essay
Structuring your essay according to a reader logic means assessing your thesis along with trusting exactly what your reader needs to learn, and in what arrangement, as a way to comprehend and be convinced from your debate because it evolves. Easy and simple way to do so is to map the article's notions with a published story. Such an account can provide you a preliminary list of your thoughts, and enable one to remind yourself in every turn of the reader's needs in understanding your thought.
Essay maps request that you predict where your reader may expect background information, counter argument, close identification of the main source, or an alternate twist to secondary origin stuff. Composing maps aren't worried about paragraphs so muchas having sections within an essay writing. They expect the key argumentative moves you expect your composition to generate. Try making your map such as that:
    Condition your thesis at a sentence or 2, then compose a second sentence expressing why it is vital to create certain assert. Indicate, to put it differently, what a reader could know by researching the claim with you. Here you are expecting your answer to this ""why"" issue you will finally flesh out in your conclusion.
    Begin your next sentence like that: ""To be convinced with my own argue, very first thing that a reader should understand is ..."" Then say why this is very first thing a reader needs to know, and title a couple of items of evidence which you think will produce the situation. This will start off you on answering the ""what"" issue. (alternatively, you can come to realize that very first thing your reader has to understand is a few background details.)
    Start every one of the subsequent sentences like this: ""Next thing my reader needs to learn is why ..."" Once again, state, and then name some evidence. Continue till you have mapped out on that your own essay.
Your map should naturally take you as a result of several preliminary responses to the standard questions about what, how, and the reason why. It is not a contract, even nevertheless--that the arrangement in which the ideas appear isn't just a stiff one. Composing maps are elastic; nevertheless they develop along with your thoughts.
Signals of Difficulty
A common structural flaw in college essays is that the ""walkthrough"" (also labeled ""summary"" or ""outline""). Walkthrough essays follow the structure of the sources rather than establishing their particular personal. Such essays generally have a descriptive thesis as opposed to an 1. Be skeptical of paragraph openers that lead off with ""time"" phrases (""original,"" ""next,"" ""afterwards,"" ""afterward"") or even ""listing"" words (""too,"" ""a second,"" ""also""). Even though they don't necessarily indicate trouble, these paragraph timers usually indicate that a composition's thesis and structure require function: They imply that the composition only imitates the chronology of this source text (at the case of keywords: First this comes to pass, then, and later another thing ... ) or lists example after example (""Additionally the use of color signals another manner which the painting differentiates between nice and wicked"")."
,"A clear introduction with a well defined structure, Logically structured body paragraphs which include supporting evidence from academic sources. A clear conclusion which restates your topic and summarizes your essay and thesis.
A basic essay consists of three main parts: Introduction, body, and conclusion. Following this format will help you write and organize an essay. However, flexibility is important. While keeping this basic essay format in mind, let the topic and specific assignment guide the writing and organization.
Parts of an Essay
Introduction : The introduction guides your reader into the paper by introducing the topic. It should
begin with a hook that catches the reader’s interest.
Thesis Statement:
The thesis statement concisely states the main idea or argument of the essay, sets
limits on the topic, and can indicate the organization of the essay.
Body :
The body of the essay supports the main points presented in the thesis. Each point is
developed by one or more paragraphs and supported with specific details. These
details can include support from research and experiences, depending on the
assignment.
Transitions
Transitions connect paragraphs to each other and to the thesis. They are used within and between
paragraphs to help the paper flow from one topic to the next. These transitions can be one or two words
(“first,” “next,” “in addition,” etc.) or one or two sentences that bring the reader to the next main point.
Conclusion
The conclusion brings together all the main points of the essay. It refers back to the thesis statement
and leaves readers with a final thought and sense of closure by resolving any ideas brought up in the
essay. It may also address the implications of the argument. In the conclusion, new topics or ideas that
were not developed in the paper should not be introduced.
Citations
If your paper incorporates research, be sure to give credit to each source using in-text citations and a
Works Cited/References/Bibliography page. Refer to the MLA Format, APA Format, or Turabian Format

What can I do to make my hair less greasy?,Try changing brands of shampoo and conditioner. Certain ones just don't work for my hair. Also (for me) it can depend on the time of year. Like right now (the start of winter) my hair is so dry. Even though it's the same shampoo and conditioner I use for summer.
,"I have a seemingly counterintuitive suggestion: Of course if you’re not shampooing regularly already, you should shampoo more often.
However, if you ARE shampooing regularly, and it’s not working, I would suggest trying to CUT DOWN on shampooing. Shampooing strips hair of natural oils, and your scalp may produce more and more as a result.
Search up “no -poo”, there communities of people doing this and it works for them. Might not work for everyone.
Also, use dry shampoo!!! Basically it’s alcohol and powder in a aerosol can. Spray it in your hair, wait 3 minutes, then comb it all out. It rids all the oil and germs. There’s even dark dry shampoo for dark hair! (Lol I discovered it just this month and it’s really improved my hair situation.) If it works good on my long hair, I can imagine it’ll work even better for shorter hair.
If your hair gets too dry, take a tiny bit of coconut oil and comb that over the ends of your hair (not the scalp). Wash every other day, or if you sweat/get dirty. Otherwise, shower but put on a shower cap (or a walmart bag like i do...it’s very loud though)."
,Don't put grease?
,Shampoo often.  Use a shampoo designed to improve oily hair .... Almost every brand has a selection like that.

How Do You Pick A Lock ?,"Okay so you neek a pocket knife and a big paper clip.

You bend the paper clip so that there is a straight part on it. You stick that into the top of the lock. If you look you will see little like shelves sort of and you have to make sure all of those are pressed up.Then you take the pocket knife and turn the lock."
,"If the movies are to be believed, all you need is a hair pin which you insert into the lock and then jiggle around for five seconds or so. The, hey presto, the door swings open and you enter with a big grin on your face.

Unfortunately, it's slightly more complicated than that. Indeed, most burglars tend to use brute force rather dexterity to gain entry. More crude battering ram than hair pin, to be honest.

The only people that can successfully pick any kind of secure lock is a locksmith and he will need something called a skeleton key to do so. Or rather a whole bunch of skeletons keys until the lock opens.

In any case, most modern locks are not designed to be easily picked. Not like the days of old when there were certain cars that would start with the key off a corned beef tin."
,"I happened to stumble across this response and just could not resist the opportunity to reply.

I am sorry, but your answer lacks any insight or basic knowledge regarding lock smithing. I guess you have never witnessed a lock smith manipulating a secured lock in lieu of a key. You might be surprised to learn that a lock smith can actually ""pick"" the lock using a ""lock pick"". However, you do not necessarily need to be a lock smith to ""pick"" a lock. With a lot of patience and considerable practice, anyone can learn to pick a lock without the formal training received by the lock smith.

In some cases, the associated tools of the trade may not be required. For instance, given the scenario, the only tool that may be needed is a credit card. Using a credit card, however, to compress the locking mechanism would not technically be considered ""picking the lock"" but rather deemed ""breaking and entering""."
,"You can pick a lock from locksmith firm. For this you just need to look for a locksmith company online and see the feedback they have got. You can even simply search for ""locksmith in San Francisco""."
,You can pick a lock from Eagle Locksmith.

,"Lock picking is defined as the manipulation of a lock's components to open the lock without a normal key. Therefore to pick a lock successfully one must understand the principles of both lock and key. A standard deadbolt lock consists of pins tumblers that are rotated by the key to open the lock. Most locks are similar in concept so learning this method of lock picking will serve you well. 

Buy a practice lock. Get a standard five-pin deadbolt lock that can be disassembled. 
Remove all but the first pin closest to the front of the lock.
The way to pick a door lock is by maneuvering the pin tumblers to the sheer line. The sheer line is a mechanism of measurement that tells the lock it is okay to open. As a key lifts the first pin it tumbles into its sheer line groove, the key is already entering the gap of the second pin, and so on.
Fashion the pick tool. Pick tools can be made from a straightened paperclip, the flat end of a hairpin, or a tiny flathead screwdriver. They can also be fashioned out of straight or safety pins, or an industrial staple.
Turn the lock upside down and watch as gravity pulls the pin down. This shows where to insert the pick and apply gentle pressure downward. When you hit the sheer line, the plug will turn and the student will know the feel and pressure needed to release a pin. Turn the lock right side up and practice.
Once the one pin has been mastered, add another pin back into the lock. Close the lock and try again. If the first pin is not released, the second pin cannot be engaged. Keep practicing and adding pins until all five are back in the lock.
With concentrated focus on the lock picking, mastery of this technique can take as little as an hour.  The more pins that a lock has, the sturdier the pick will need to be.

One never knows where and when a lock will need to be picked.  However, mastering the art of lock picking may get an individual back into their own car or home without incurring the expense of calling a locksmith."
,You can borrow a new one from the mother.
,The BEST way is to use a key
,No no no the best way its to cut it off or my Fave use a shot gun!!! BAM! But note you will not see the lock anymore...

How can a teenager (middle school) lose 20 pounds quickly?,"Uhhh, why would you need that to happen? Don't do anything..."
,"I usually don't respond to these questions but Ill let this time be an occasion.

Despite how convenient it may sound, losing weight ""quickly"" would probably not feel as rewarding for long. More like a short lived impulse that after it happens, turns into a down feeling. If you take the process duration and plan it you will feel happier once you accomplish it. Knowing your planned determination was a result of doing properly (long route) it also builds a sense of control once the results progress.
A lot of people have told me they felt that ""now what"" feeling after quickly rushing off their weight goals like you're talking about. I think if you want to, you can lose 20 pounds. But can you find a way to urgently cheat through it..? Probably not. Im sure its possible though. Maybe you could.
Just don't accept any easy routes as truth. Most of stuff you'll hear online will be lies and unsafe and the other 20% scams. Id say 80% of the methods you will hear online are false.
I have heard a lot of them myself and I have not once tried to lose weight myself! That, Ironically, is why Im warning you. Because with all the bs I have seen then I could only imagine what someone searching for intentionally will find.

Im sure everyone does not agree with me, but this is my advice. Besides of course the ""ask your doctor"" thought response."
,Salads and exercise
,Talk to a doctor!! Please don't do anything dangerous!!!
,Oh my !  Ho did this person gain 20 pounds so quickly?
,"You didn't gain it quickly, so don't expect to lose it quickly.  The proper way is to eat a well balanced, well portioned diet. Stay hydrated and get at least 8 hours of sleep.  Also get 30 minutes of exercise everyday. Just walk. It is free and easy to do. If you don't have 30 minutes at one time, do two 15 minute walks or three 10 minute walks."
,"Create a Calorie deficit.
Figure out what you are consuming daily and reduce it by 200 to 300 calories if you are maintaining weight, and not gaining weight.
Add in at least 10,000 steps a day and you will lose weight. Since you didn't gain it overnight, do not expect to lose it overnight.   "
,"I believe you should focus more on eating healthy and getting proper nutrition than simply losing weight. You will lose weight along the way, which is good, but to strive to eat healthy for the sake of it is more of a lifestyle than a goal. If you tried to just lose weight, then it is likely you will gain it back once you've lost if your goal is a particular destination rather than an overall health habit change. Also, just because you're eating enough to lose doesn't necessarily equate to eating good.
Additionally, it is important to know that even though items may have the same about of calories in them, doesn't mean that they're equally as fattening contrary to popular belief. You actually burn foods like almonds faster than crackers even if you intake the same amount of calories of either.
Also, stay clear of ""diet"" foods. Special ""K"" chips, fat free cookies, etc. They're actually worse for you, and in order to make them ""fat free"" or ""sugar free"" they either have to load in tons of sugar or artificial sweetener, which is the real devil here. Eat some real food and not factory-crap advertised as good for diets.
(Added) Sugar is the biggest perpetrator in obesity. It does not carry nutrients or anything humans need in it, but it is very fattening, addicting, and causes cravings and hunger. In fact, sugar is more addicting than heroin, which can perhaps paint a picture on the extent sugar is what causes cravings and misleading hunger signals, making it detrimental to our health. So try to limit sugar, yet don't get sweets and junk food that is labeled ""sugar free."" They contain artificial sweeteners, which is worse for you even though they don't taste nearly as good."
,"In order to lose wait follow these steps:
Consult with a medical professional
Determine if you actually need to lose weight, and if so, how much
Make sure you’re doing it for the right reasons
Be realistic about losing weight fast
Make your health your priority
Limit restaurant meals
Get plenty of exercises
Drink a lot of water
Stop drinking your calories
Avoid fad diets"

I also wear 4 rings all the time, My engagement ring on my left hand, and on my right I have a Lindy star, my birthstone, and my Daddy's wedding ring. I wear a diamond heart necklace that mt Fiancee' gave me for valentine's day 6 years ago, and only take it off when I want to wear something different for a special occasion.

How Do I Wish A Girl A Happy Birthday In French?,"""Happy birthday"" is actually the same for a girl and a boy in French - the word ""anniversaire"" is always masculine, so its modifier - the ""happy"" part - is too.

There are two possible ways of saying ""happy birthday"" in French:
Joyeux anniversaire!
Bon anniversaire!
These two are totally interchangeable, so it doesn't matter which you use. Quite often, when wishing somebody happy birthday online or in a text message, people will just write ""bon anniv,"" which is just an abbreviation of ""bon anniversaire.""

Other Birthday-Related Phrases in French
Mon anniversaire - My birthday
Un gâteau d'anniversaire - A birthday cake
Une carte d'anniversaire - A birthday card
Des cadeaux d'anniversaire - Birthday presents
Quelle est la date de ton anniversaire? - When is your birthday?

Singing ""Happy Birthday"" In French The French sing ""Joyeux Anniversaire"" to the same tune that we sing ""Happy Birthday."" The French version goes like this:

Joyeux anniversaire Joyeux anniversaire Joyeux anniversaire (you might insert the birthday girl/boy's name here)
Joyeux anniversaire!"
How To Say 'Birthday Greetings' In Italian?,"To send someone your birthday greetings in Italian, you only really need one word: Auguri!

This word is the shortened version of the slightly more laborious auguri di buon compleanno.

The word auguri comes from the verb augurare which means 'to wish'- so the closest English expression would probably be something like 'best wishes'.

Like the term 'best wishes', auguri is not limited to use for birthdays. Instead, it is used at various occasions in Italian and is often the first word you'll hear at the chime of midnight when people are welcoming in a new year.

If you want to extend birthday greetings especially fervently, you may want to modify auguri with the superlatve suffix -oni. In Italian, this suffix is used to denote great size, so auguroni would be the word for 'great big birthday wishes'.

Alternatively, you could use the indefinite adjective tanti meaning 'many' to say tanti auguri.
The expression tanti auguri is also the title of the Italian song 'happy birthday' and is a phrase that often decorates birthday cards and banners that you might buy at the local cartoleria or 'stationery shop'..

One final option is to simply say buon compelanno meaning 'happy birthday'- the main thing is to remember to say something!

If you do forget someone's birthday, you may find this page helpful in redeeming yourself."
What Are The Advantages And Disadvantages Of A Private Education?,"A private education can have many advantages.
Private education offers the chance for a child to grow in terms of personal development and confidence.
Many private schools are highly academic and are ideal for a motivated, academic student. However many private schools are less academically focused and aim to provide a good all round education for children on a variety of levels rather than being purely academic.
State schools are not always in good catchment areas and private education can ensure that the majority of the classes are full of motivated pupils in many cases.
Personal development is highly valued and children get more individual attention in the private sector.
The downside is that students at private schools do not mix with a wide mixture of other children from different backgrounds and may have a narrower perspective on a range of social issues. Conversely some may argue that this is a positive in favour of the private sector.
One disadvantage which is a major one is cost. Many parents and children are at a disadvantage because of the cost of fees which are usually very high - the present Labour Government withdrew assisted place funding which benefited many gifted children.
There are some scholarships and bursaries available but the competition for them is high."
,Advantages And Disadvantages Of A Private Education
,Disadvantages of private schools in Nigeria
,"Positives:
Small class sizes.
Impressive test scores (not always, though).
A wider variety of extra-curricular on-site opportunities (not always)
A smaller tightly knit school community.
Not necessarily tied to the National Curriculum (some independent schools follow it, anyway).
Not required to sit SATs.

Negatives:
High cost (for most a consideration!).

""Keeping up with the Jones'"": if your child's classmates are wealthy and manifest that wealth, will your child feel left out if your family doesn't have as much money?

Many private schools do not require their teachers to have the same level of achievement or accreditation as is required in the state sector.

Cultural or social isolation: your child will probably a larger range of other types of people in a state school.

Being tapped for money: if you thought the state sector schools are always fund-raising, that's not a patch on the work that private schools have to do to get extra money in.

Can be bad or good
Hot-housing: not an issue everywhere, but do you want your child in an environment with high academic expectations? What if that's not what they're like?

Formality (independents are usually more formally run)."

,"If your aim is to improve your aptitude and knowledge base in a particular field, all education pertaining to this subject will useful. If this statement is assumed true, then the benefits afforded by private tuition are enormous. You will have the advantage of a whole teacher to yourself, with their lesson plans and strategies of teaching designed just for you! It seems impossible to doubt the enormous benefits this will offer. In a classroom, one teacher may be faced with around thirty pupils, each with different abilities, different rates of learning, and individual strengths and weaknesses; yet despite this, for the majority of the lesson the teacher will be forced to treat his class as if it contained just one student. He or she will orate from one end of the classroom, unable to gauge how effectively each pupil is assimilating the lesson. The lesson plans will be designed to fit the needs of the average pupil; and the teacher will proceed at a rate suitable for the average pupil.
In this environment it is all to easy for a bright child or adolescent to fail to grasp one particular point, as the swathe of teacher talk washes over them like the unrelenting tides. It is unlikely even the best of teachers would spot the particular point of misunderstanding cast on the countenance on one pupil, hidden amongst so many other faces. To draw attention to their lack of understanding can be intimidating for the pupil: Everyone else is silent, so they must have understood. Do I want to draw attention to myself? All too often the misunderstanding goes unexpressed and unaided. The obvious benefit of one to one tuition is that the tutor can tailor their teaching style to the abilities of their student. They will be able to gauge the level of the pupils understanding, and, more importantly, track down the sources of misunderstanding, and deal with them effectively. Away from the bustle of the classroom, the student will feel more able to voice their difficulties; and having just one pupil to deal with, the teacher will be more capable of resolving them.
Compared to the conflicts of the classroom, fraught with distractions and intimidations from other pupils, the relaxed environment of tutor and student can be a safe haven of erudition. Most tutors will be willing to travel to the pupil's house, allowing them the benefit of learning in a happy home location.A tutor will be able to focus their teaching on a particular area: The pupil may be very competent in mathematics overall, but be deficient in calculus, with this specific weakness undermining their whole confidence in the subject. Maybe they are highly literate and proficient in English language, but shy away from public speaking. The syllabus may demand some oral work (foreign languages certainly do), so it would be a shame if this particular and minor deficiency detracted from their overall grade in the subject. Even if the pupil is performing well at school or college, it is highly likely that some private tuition will give then the edge over their peers. For it is their friends and contemporaries that they are competing against - many of whomay already be receiving tuition. In an age where extra tuition is almost becoming the norm, it may be necessary to join in, or risk being left behind. "

,"At this stage of the game, it doesn’t really matter whether or not he’s cheating or she is cheating. You suspect that he/she is. Whether you’re right or wrong about that, you clearly don’t trust him/ her .So the lack of evidence proves nothing to you.Then, you’ll conclude that he’s even craftier than you thought, and he’s covering up too well to get caught.....
Contact : Spycyjones (at) gmail (dot) com 
People I know, cheaters I know react to their partners ' accusations by cheating on them even more. So...be sure of it, have proof because as soon as you say something about it, and it happens to not be true...it is going to change the relationship. BUT if you have good reasons and maybe even proof, it would make the relationship come into the light of what it really is. The change was already brought in by him/her and not you in that situation.
Good luck

A web design agency Dubai has to offer will help you with the onpage optimization

How many teenager's father's walk around their house wearing nothing but a towel? With a thirteen year old daughter alone with him?,"I don't know a lot of thirteen year olds right now but I never knew dads like that. Maybe he feels okay with it around you because your family and/or home is where he believes he can do things like that because he feels secure there and/or he is your general weirdo. It could be a general male thing like, ""I can do whatever I want because I am a man!"". In other words, lazy.

Does he do it when your mother is at home? If not, talk about it with your mother because some dads get angry. Why? Because in their mind, it's logical to get mad at this because you're being disrespectful and this and that and blah blah blah.

If your dad is not a creeper or a mean dude, then ask him not to do that around you in a sort of scared child manner. Say you are really uncomfortable about it. Remember to say it nicely and not accusatory or in a negative manner. Say it with confusion. That usually works when my stubborn dad won't listen to me.

If both parents are unreasonable and won't be able to understand that you want him to stop walking around the house in only a towel, you're going to have to deal with it. Sorry but just ignore it and everything else, because there'll be more later on.  I know it sounds unfair but you're going to have to be the best of what humanity has to offer while your parents are not. Just concentrate on college, financial stability, and friends. Live a happy life. Peace! :3"
,"Nope  that  is  not  normal  for  any  dad  to do  I  am sorry  but  he  is  not showing no respect   at  all  and  He  could  be  having  other thoughts  in  his  head , You need  to tell  someone  "
,"My dad walks around naked all the time. My stepmom doesn't think it's weird because he's done this as long as I can remember. I'm 13 now, and a girl, but my dad doesn't care. I just try to ignore it, especially when he gets boners or takes a shower with me."
,"A lot of men do that, and at least he's wearing a towel and not nothing I guess it's because most men are quite open with themselves being naked around there house it's sort of like an ""alpha thing"""

"Alic-ins Life Insurance Was Purchased From Sears Years Ago. Can You Tell Me If It Is Term, Whole Life Or Accident Only?","It is probably just accident only cover, but it will do no harm to double check if you are unsure what type of policy you have.

Have a look at the small print and Terms & Conditions document you would have been given at the time of opening the life insurance policy. There should be some kind of indication that can tell if you if the policy is Term, Whole Life or Accident Cover.

You should also been in receipt of regular company literature or statements from your policy provider. Scan any letters with a fine tooth and look for any clues about the type of policy you hold. If there is a contact telephone number or an advisor named in the letter in the event you need to get in touch; try to get hold of them. There should also be a policy document number that you may need to quote when making any correspondence.

If you still cannot find any information, the best thing to do is to get in touch with Allicins Life Insurance. If they are unable to help they may direct you to speak to Sears Insurance.

Here are the following contact details you may need when getting in touch with Sears:

How do you handle life crushing news?,"I’m interested in how others handle life crushing  Some of you know what I’ve been through, others do not. If I may I would like to tell you how I handled the most life stressing year of my life.  Last January I bumped my leg in my shop.  I have something called Charcot Marie Tooth Sysdrome.  This causes little or knowfeeling in my legs-  the bump turned into a sore.  When I noticed it during my shower I washed it treated it and bandaged it.  It healed but 3 months later it came back. I cleaned it, treated it, and it healed, BUT it came back.  Long story short I passed out in my bedroom and layer about 3 hours on the floor..  I came to my wife was there with a fireman. The out again.  I came to in the ER in time to hear the doctor tell my wife and son that they were flying me to a trauma hospital  because the only organs I had that were still working were my brain, heart, and lungs.  The doctor told my famil that I wouldn’t make it to the other hospital I would be DOA before the plane landed.  While flying over the Rocky Mtns, I had my 3rd heart attack.  The leg wound caused it all, it turned to an infection, which turned into sepsis, which turned to gangrene of the leg.  They kept cutting parts of my leg away, three surgeons wanTed to cut it off because it morphed into  Flash Estinfilm Virus!  Moved To o wound hospital  they cut 15 square inches off the leg about 3/4” Deep.  Total of 59 leg surgeries, plus Gallbladder removal surgery, Bladder surgery, Eye surgery, skin graphs, and heart surgery!  Today my doctors released me To a normal Life.  I still have my leg, looks diferent than the other but i still have it.  How do I handle life crushing news. Prayer, God that still performs Miracles, and a lot of good friends who , kept me going through kind words and prayer,  Thank you all, isn’t enough"
,"I tend to take a deep breath, handle what needs to be dealt with immediately, then find a quiet place to cry. Then start dealing with what needs to be dealt with or do research. I can't sit still. I need to be doing something. Then at the end of the day say my prayers, have a cry and cuddle with my dogs."

"When you chat with someone online ( friend ) , how long do you drag the conversation? Hours? Days? Because I don't know how to become ' close' with my friend (guy) & i wanna become sociable.","I do little short bursts. Maybe with a closer friend, you could drag it out that long (you mean start talking randomly and not establishing an end right?) but usually you ask them about something, then follow with a little chat. If they seem uninterested, maybe check the topic? Or you could end it with an “I’m going to sleep now, ttyl”
End it when you feel like you have to end it."
,Why would you want to drag out a conversation? Just talk to the person for a bit and come back later.  Most people get bored over chit chat.
Hi I'm a 12 year old boy and my bf is 14. We're bi. And we want to have sex but I'm scared and don't know what to do. What should I do?,"Scared?
Then don't have sex because you are not ready."
,"Woah! Not cool. You guys are way too young for sex. I dunno what the law is like where you live, but most places it is downright illegal to have sex at that age. Just wait."
,At 12 years old you should not be thinking of having sex with anybody I have to think the 14 year old boyfriend is pressuring you to do this.  It is against the law and you could both end up in trouble.  It's against the law for a reason and that's because you're still a child and not ready to make these decisions yet.  Please listen to the advice you've got here because you're going to get really messed up if you give in to this.
,"I mean, if you wnat to then you want to but you should probably be alone together and in a goooood spot. Closets work well (kay, maybe not, but you gotta admit nobody will see you)"
,"If you are scared then you are not ready.
At least one of the two of you have the sense to have condoms and know how to safely use them...I hope."
,Well...of course you are scared and you should be. Your bf should even be more afraid. Him getting caught having sex with you can get him arrested and ending up on a sexual predator list. You are entirely too young to be making such a decision. Not to mention the risks.  There are STDs. If you should get one then you hace to tell someone so you can get treated. You are not even a teenager yet. You cannot get medical attention without a parent or guardian. You need to wait.

Does it seem to anyone else that too many of the rising younger generation are doing nothing of real value in their lives?,"I think so.
I never see a teenager without a phone in their hand.
I never see children playing.
Most of them can't carry on a conversation with you."
,Yes this generation has it all mixed up. Everything is on the computer
What can I do to make my hair less greasy?,Try changing brands of shampoo and conditioner. Certain ones just don't work for my hair. Also (for me) it can depend on the time of year. Like right now (the start of winter) my hair is so dry. Even though it's the same shampoo and conditioner I use for summer.
,"I have a seemingly counterintuitive suggestion: Of course if you’re not shampooing regularly already, you should shampoo more often.
However, if you ARE shampooing regularly, and it’s not working, I would suggest trying to CUT DOWN on shampooing. Shampooing strips hair of natural oils, and your scalp may produce more and more as a result.
Search up “no -poo”, there communities of people doing this and it works for them. Might not work for everyone.
Also, use dry shampoo!!! Basically it’s alcohol and powder in a aerosol can. Spray it in your hair, wait 3 minutes, then comb it all out. It rids all the oil and germs. There’s even dark dry shampoo for dark hair! (Lol I discovered it just this month and it’s really improved my hair situation.) If it works good on my long hair, I can imagine it’ll work even better for shorter hair.
If your hair gets too dry, take a tiny bit of coconut oil and comb that over the ends of your hair (not the scalp). Wash every other day, or if you sweat/get dirty. Otherwise, shower but put on a shower cap (or a walmart bag like i do...it’s very loud though)."
,Don't put grease?
,Shampoo often.  Use a shampoo designed to improve oily hair .... Almost every brand has a selection like that.

How do you handle life crushing news?,"I’m interested in how others handle life crushing  Some of you know what I’ve been through, others do not. If I may I would like to tell you how I handled the most life stressing year of my life.  Last January I bumped my leg in my shop.  I have something called Charcot Marie Tooth Sysdrome.  This causes little or knowfeeling in my legs-  the bump turned into a sore.  When I noticed it during my shower I washed it treated it and bandaged it.  It healed but 3 months later it came back. I cleaned it, treated it, and it healed, BUT it came back.  Long story short I passed out in my bedroom and layer about 3 hours on the floor..  I came to my wife was there with a fireman. The out again.  I came to in the ER in time to hear the doctor tell my wife and son that they were flying me to a trauma hospital  because the only organs I had that were still working were my brain, heart, and lungs.  The doctor told my famil that I wouldn’t make it to the other hospital I would be DOA before the plane landed.  While flying over the Rocky Mtns, I had my 3rd heart attack.

U could try warming a small dish, wrapping a towel around it and lay with the blocked ear on it. Sometimes the gentle heat ( with a massage ) can help loosen the wax and help the water and wax drain out."

Hi I'm a 12 year old boy and my bf is 14. We're bi. And we want to have sex but I'm scared and don't know what to do. What should I do?,"Scared?
Then don't have sex because you are not ready."
,"Woah! Not cool. You guys are way too young for sex. I dunno what the law is like where you live, but most places it is downright illegal to have sex at that age. Just wait."
,At 12 years old you should not be thinking of having sex with anybody I have to think the 14 year old boyfriend is pressuring you to do this.  It is against the law and you could both end up in trouble.  It's against the law for a reason and that's because you're still a child and not ready to make these decisions yet.  Please listen to the advice you've got here because you're going to get really messed up if you give in to this.
,"I mean, if you wnat to then you want to but you should probably be alone together and in a goooood spot. Closets work well (kay, maybe not, but you gotta admit nobody will see you)"
,"If you are scared then you are not ready.
At least one of the two of you have the sense to have condoms and know how to safely use them...I hope."
,Well...of course you are scared and you should be. Your bf should even be more afraid. Him getting caught having sex with you can get him arrested and ending up on a sexual predator list. You are entirely too young to be making such a decision. Not to mention the risks.  There are STDs. If you should get one then you hace to tell someone so you can get treated. You are not even a teenager yet. You cannot get medical attention without a parent or guardian. You need to wait.

is it normal for a 12 year old to have hidden depression?,"I'm so sorry, a lot of young people suffer from teen depression. Some causes may be physical or mental. But the bible tells us at Isaiah 33:24: ""No resident will say, I am sick"". There's a website that I often refer to to help with this question along with others you may need answers to, jw.org. "
,"ANONYMOUS.........THE SYMPTOMS OF TEEN DEPRESSION CAN APPEAR DURING ADOLESCENCE.
WHAT PARENTS CAN DO; 
Recognize that depressed teens may find it hard to express their feelings or may not understand what is happening to them. They may not even be aware of the symptoms of depression.
Teens tend to express their depression in ways different from those of adults, so be alert to major changes in your child’s behavior, eating habits, moods, sleep patterns, or social interactions—especially if the changes persist for weeks.
Take seriously any comments or hints regarding suicide.
If you suspect depression (not just the blues), consider getting a professional diagnosis.
Help your teen adhere to the doctor’s prescribed treatment, and consult the doctor if you see no improvement or observe unpleasant side effects.
Have a stable family routine for eating, exercising, and sleeping.
Maintain good communication with your teen, and help him or her to deal with any stigma associated with depression.
Because depression can make one feel alone, ashamed, or worthless, regularly reassure your teen of your love."
,Depression anybody can suffer from it. There are always telltale signs and would be prudent the person in question not to be left alone.

Why is lifting weights better than cardio?,"For my body, cardio is. Weight lifting would bulk me up making me look even fatter!"
,Neither one is good for me!  Makes you sweat.
,"It isn't.
They both contribute to calorie loss and fat burning. Cardio and diet contribute to burning Visceral fat, whereas Lifting weights to create Lean Dense muscle contribute to burning more Subcutaneous fat.
More correctly, they both contribute to overall fat loss, but Cardio usually hits both. It is actually important to combine the two forms of exercise for a well balanced health.
Cardio also burns in the here and now whereas Weight lifting caloric burn, usually lasts for 24 to 48 hours depending upon the exercise. ""Dead Lifts"" and ""Squats"" are just two examples of weight training exercises that can burn calories up to 48 hours."
,Lifting weights one thing and maintaining it is another. In the long run stick to simple exercises.

What can I do to make my hair less greasy?,Try changing brands of shampoo and conditioner. Certain ones just don't work for my hair. Also (for me) it can depend on the time of year. Like right now (the start of winter) my hair is so dry. Even though it's the same shampoo and conditioner I use for summer.
,"I have a seemingly counterintuitive suggestion: Of course if you’re not shampooing regularly already, you should shampoo more often.
However, if you ARE shampooing regularly, and it’s not working, I would suggest trying to CUT DOWN on shampooing. Shampooing strips hair of natural oils, and your scalp may produce more and more as a result.
Search up “no -poo”, there communities of people doing this and it works for them. Might not work for everyone.
Also, use dry shampoo!!! Basically it’s alcohol and powder in a aerosol can. Spray it in your hair, wait 3 minutes, then comb it all out. It rids all the oil and germs. There’s even dark dry shampoo for dark hair! (Lol I discovered it just this month and it’s really improved my hair situation.) If it works good on my long hair, I can imagine it’ll work even better for shorter hair.
If your hair gets too dry, take a tiny bit of coconut oil and comb that over the ends of your hair (not the scalp). Wash every other day, or if you sweat/get dirty. Otherwise, shower but put on a shower cap (or a walmart bag like i do...it’s very loud though)."
,Don't put grease?
,Shampoo often.  Use a shampoo designed to improve oily hair .... Almost every brand has a selection like that.
"My Brother Cheated On His Girlfriend, Should I Tell Her?","No, you should not tell her.  It is there business.  I know its tough and you want to but it is not your business to tell her.  Guys and girls both cheat sometimes it is sad and awful but that is life.  She will probably eventually find out some other way.  Your brother is your family and you don't want to start problems.  Maybe if you still feel like telling her have her find out some other way that don't involve you or your friends or family and that it don't come back on.  Good luck and take care."
,"That's a difficult question...it depends n what you are willing to deal with personally. What your brother is doing is terrible, but horribly commonplace. Should she know? Absolutely. The question is, are you willing to damage your relationship with your brother? Depending on how old he is, he will likely get over the 'betrayal' of you telling his girlfriend the truth, but in the meantime, his motto would be to keep out! Did you personally witness cheating, did he tell you, or did you suspect it? If you personally witnessed it and you feel she might be in some danger (STD's, etc.), perhaps try to remind your brother of the very selfish danger he's putting her in. I know it's hard, but remind him how angry and hurt he would feel if she betrayed him. It is up to you whether or not to confront him or her, but you have many options. Could you tell a parent and have them talk to him (without him knowing it was you)? It's true, it's their business, but the people being hurt rarely like to be the laughing stock as everyone stands around them and wonders..."
,Listen to lisamarie1; that's one of the best answers I've seen on blurtit.
,"Come on if you say he's your brother and you care about him; you should
tell him whats wrong in his relationship. But if you keep it to
yourself, you're not being loyal to him."
,"No, you shouldn't tell her that.  You need to remain loyal to your brother in this regard, no matter how hard that may be and no matter how much he does stupid things.  Hopefully, he will eventually come around and realize he needs to get his act together. "
,"Guys, listen...... !!!carefully.if you will never commit in a relationship, please never be in it.... Being liberal is a disease that does not have cure! I meant cancer you hear???. Anytime you cheat on somebody that dsz.... Will never go. Why? You have planted a seed and all it needs is your thought"
,Don't get involved that will just create drama! Your brother will just get mad at you and that will start a whoe other problem. YOUR not the one who is at fault so YOU shouldn't have to clean up after your brother. However you should try to convince your brother to tell his girlfriend the truth. Hope this helps. Good Luck!
,"I have always been very skeptical about intruding on others privacy, loved ones or colleagues.

How Can You Tell If A Girl Is Cheating On You?,"When you first start thinking a girl is cheating on you then there is obviously something wrong with your relationship and you will notice little things, like she does not answer your calls all the time. She will say she was in the bath/shower, or left it in other room, or the phone will be turned off and she will say the battery was flat.

Has she got a load of new friends that you have never heard of before or just one friend who she has not mentioned to you? When you query her she will say that she has told you about her, so then it starts putting doubts in your head and then you start to imagine it is you with the problem.

She starts to argue with you for no reason, and then storms out, accusing you of always starting arguments. Has she taken a bit more care of herself when going out, for example: Spending more time doing her hair, wearing best clothes when she is out with the girls, showing a bit more cleavage or a bit more leg?

Never let a girl who you are in a relationship with go to a nightclub without you, there is a reason she does not want you there. Lads are bad when they are out, but believe me girls are twenty times worse.

It is very easy for girls to get noticed and even if they are not the prettiest there is always some lad in any town who will want to brag about going with that girl in the club last night. Check her mobile call history for numbers that have no names. Maybe even ring the number, and you never know it might be answered by someone saying hello sweetheart/gorgeous etc.

Only someone who is very close to your girlfriend would do this and it would certainly have their name next to the number. If she insists on going out with her girlfriends tell her you will meet her somewhere later on. See if she then has a change of plan, or texts(likely) or phones(unlikely) to say they have all gone somewhere else as it was quiet.

When you see her next time she will say she had no signal to let you know they had a late change of plans. Do not tell your mates you think she is cheating as it could be them who she is cheating with. It is very easy to catch a cheat, but you will know if she is cheating because your instincts and your heart will tell you."
,"Easy, you will tell. Her eyes will be burning a different stare. If she doesn't act differently at all, but you still have the inkling (or if she has a history), then she is probably a much more experienced cheater.

Cocky, dramatic and beautiful girls are much more likely to cheat, most likely with your friends if they are reasonably close. If you think she is cheating, she probably is and if she isn't and you think she is, then you probably shouldn't be with her anyway.

Tell her you want to spend some time away from her for a week or two (detach yourself from her because you're probably being paranoid needy and pushing her away), then don't talk for a couple of days. 

Remember women cheat mostly for emotional reasons and they will rationalise it and say that was out of their control, thus shedding responsibility. If she seems cold she is probably blaming you for her guilt (as she is controlled by her emotions).

Everyone is capable of cheating (Its hard-wired into us), the best thing you can do is to keep one step back from a girl at all times and only reward good behaviour with attention. If you feel she is cheating, then don't do all those good things you have been doing for her. Her rationale if she were cheating on you would be: ""If you make me feel as though I am cheating, then it's almost as bad as if I was"".

Remember there are some amazing girls out there who are much more mature and stable, however you will find a lot of gorgeous girls have a lot of personal problems because they have never had to grow up or be responsible for their actions.

If you have one of these girls, don't try to see the inner beauty - have fun physically, instead. They will cause you enormous heartache. Find yourself a different girl, in fact find yourself a number of girlfriends (don't just stick to one girlfriend because it guarantees you sex that is disrespectful to her and to yourself).

Anyway don't worry to much about it, If she is cheating, don't give her the joy of the chase, ignore her burn all that lovey stuff you had together (they were only props in her fantasy anyway, while she had the romance with you, she took the penis from others like a true champ). Find somebody new and don't make the same mistake. Peace out."
,"There's always ways to find out. Try to get close to her best friend, one of her best friends might rat on her friend because they see what a great guy you are.

Also if she always calls you or texts you every morning saying something sweet, and all of a sudden she stops texting you, then something is up.

Facebook is always a good way to catch a cheater, try making a fake page and make friends with her. Start talking to her, little by little, start liking her statuses, and make her talk to you. That's how I found one of my ex girlfriends - she flirted with me on my fake page, and I never told her. I kept it this way for a while.

She gave me her number saying she was single and that she likes to drink and party that we should meet up one day, but I always said I couldn't. I used a text free number to text her I would text her from my iPod when I was in the restroom, saying ""hi how are you sweetheart?"" or ""are you busy, can we talk?"". When I walked back in the room, I would ask her who just texted her, and she would say it was her best friend.

There was one time when she told me she was having problems with a man and needed me to go pick her up that got me mad, but didn't show it. She got in the shower, and I got one of my friends to call her back and ask her if she wanted to meet up. She agreed.

When she got out of the shower I asked her if she was going to meet a friend and she said ""yeah, I'll be back soon"" so I told her I'd come with her, and then she started saying ""no, she needs me, she don't want you to see her like this, blah blah blah...""

Well guess what? I was the guy she was meeting up with! My friend picked me up and we went to meet her. I texted her, and told her I was in the black car. When she started walking to the car I rolled the window down, and the look on her face was priceless!

Sorry for posting my story, but if in your heart you feel that she's cheating, then you should follow those feelings."
,"In order to know if your girlfriend is cheating on you, you should just wait and watch the entire situation unfold. You see, if you over-react to the whole thing, she might prove that she is not cheating on you. If your love is true, and your feelings towards her are loyal, than she will for sure feel guilty, and she will come up to you and admit her mistake. So just wait for the right time.

If you want her to admit her mistake, and tell you the truth, then you should show her how much you love her. Show her what she means to you, and what her existence means to you. Tell her that her love has shown you the new part of life.

After knowing all this she will feel bad and guilty for cheating on you, and being disloyal. But then again what you're considering might only your imagination or assumptions. You see at times, we do feel scared of losing someone we love so much, and that's why such concerns enter our minds once in a while. So just have faith in yourself and your love."
,"She will often avoid your eyes, and whenever you try to make plans, she will awkwardly struggle for an excuse. If she is known to be a good liar, well, just pull her to the side and ask her if anything is wrong. Just be honest."
,"Okay, its easy I have an example: When you're done making love to your girlfriend, and you're still in  bed, hugging and kissing, say ""I know"", or ""I know what happened"", or ""I know what you did"" - something like that.

For me, it was only ""I know"" - and remember, do not mention anything about cheating. Once you've said that, if she answers with: ""I didnt cheat on you"", it's 100% certain that she did, because you didnt even mention anything about cheating. Once she says that, you say: ""I didnt even say anything like that"". If she gets mad in any way, then she cheated - simple is that."
,"It is always difficult to peep into somebody's heart and know their actual feelings and desires as well as his or her attitude. Though this task is very difficult, some people are wise enough to judge and note the feelings and desires of others. Once you develop relationships, especially with girls, you should be sensible enough to note her actual feelings and demands.

Usually girls are experts at hiding their actual feelings and desires. If you want to discover whether your girlfriend is cheating on you or not, you will have to use some measures and methods. Test her on different occasions without her notice and if she does not prove worthy, that means she is not sincere to you.

Give her chances to deal with other boys freely, and notice her movements. If she is not bothered about other boys, that means she is sincere to you. If, on the other hand, she takes more interest in other boys, that means she is cheating on you."
,"One of the first things is that you will feel it in your heart. It is a nagging sensation that finally makes you start to notice things. Maybe, as a couple you were initially very relaxed together, and suddenly you don't feel so laid back around her. Perhaps she starts pulling away a little at a time, or she isn't acting as sweet as before?

Believe me, you will know if she is cheating on you: Remember the eyes are the mirror to your soul, even the best liar can't stop the eyes from showing the truth."
,The most obvious thing that you can spot is that she is really nervous around you!
,"Women that lie will cheat, I can't stand that. If my girl ever cheats on me, I'll just toss her out and check in with the next girl on my list. If they cheat, oh well - they'll never see me again, either."
,She becomes distant and quickly gets attitude. She doesn't let you see her phone and will find any excuse to get mad. I'm just saying from experience. I'm sorry MJ.
,"Well I have done it before, it's quite simple actually. She will carry her phone about with her day and night, she wont leave it lying around where you can get it.

If you are sitting watching TV, she will  keep asking whether you are all right? Then she get all nervous, and lost for words, but trust me, in the end she will always feel guilty."
,You can tell if she hasn't been spending much time with you and doesn't want to answer your calls.
,"Well I believe my girl is doing just that. She will erase texts and calls from her phone. She said she did it because she was bored. A lot of times she does not answer my calls, and comes up with dumb excuses. 

We have been together three years and only three times have I 'hit the back'.  Now out of nowhere she likes it there.  I think she has been with someone else, and just feels bad because she let someone else hit that, and that whenever I asked her, she would just call me names.  Now that's all she wants.

She would cook lunch for me everyday.  We work at same company as drivers, we would meet there for lunch. Now she is always running late. Too bad its her conscience. She will carry that for life."
,"She sounds like a complete head-case dude! If your relationship faces a problem, but at the first chance she runs into another guys' arms, then it can't be very good.

Sit her down and tell her your fears, and ask her if she really thinks your relationship is worth carrying on. I know how much it hurts, but if she isn't 100% into you, she doesn't deserve the relationship and it's better for you in the long run to break up with her."
,"If she seems like she is hanging out with other guys, then she might be cheating on you. Ask her if she wants to go out. If she stumbles or says no, or even just sounds unsure, take that as a sign. Ask her if she still wants to be with you."
,"If she avoids you, and starts to flirt with guys."
,"Well, there are a few things. For one, don't forget the song lyrics ""Believe half of what you see and none of what you hear"". That's a good thing to remember. There will be little things a cheater will do, like lying. You don't want a liar. You definitely don't want a cheater.

If you feel there is reason to wonder, then you need to talk to your lady and find out if you are right or not. If you can't get anywhere that way, you can ask other people who know her. I do not suggest you set her up to test her, although sometimes that is the only way.

In today's world it is very important to be safe, and random flings with cheating people can have you at the clinic getting a prescription for something, or worse. Not to mention the morals you would want to be present in the mother of any children you have. Be picky - do not settle."
,"Oh that's a tough one, with me being a girl it's hard for me to answer this question, but if you have doubts just confront her and say something like: ""I want to be the only guy for you, I can't share you, I want to know, is there someone else?"".

If there is, then tough luck kid, sorry. If that doesn't work, talk to her friends and tell them how you feel. (If you do break up with her because she's shady tell her as much, but don't be to mean about it, no one likes to be talked at!).

- Erica"
,Become real cool friends with her friends. Don't go to far with it. Some of her friends who know if she's not doing right will feel bad for you if she is. You might find the truth. Sometimes even more comes from it. I did it once. What goes around comes around.
,"So, recently my girlfriend started talking to a guy on Facebook. One night whilst watching a movie with her she goes onto my laptop to check her Facebook and sits there for ages using the 'chat' feature on it.

I noticed that she's talking to the guy in question so I asked her who she's talking to - the answer was that it was a mutual friend of ours. So I left it. I checked again, and as soon as I turned my head she closes the page. So I pretended to stretch and watch TV and then noticed she reopened the chat with the guy.

I confronted her about it and asked why she lied. She got nervous and said she wasn't lying to me (she wasn't technically lying, but she did withhold the information when I asked). Eventually she told me he was being inappropriate to her, that she didn't want me getting jealous or annoyed about it, and that she was telling him to get lost.

A couple of nights later, my iPod starts bleeping, so I check it and find she had been using the Facebook app on it, and was still logged in. From what I read I saw that she had traded numbers with a guy and was texting and ringing him and talking on MSN.

Now from past experience I go by gut feeling, I'm not a jealous guy because my girlfriend has many male friends that I'm fine with. But for my girlfriend to suddenly start talking to someone and get his number a couple of days later when shes never even met the guy before is a little odd to me.

I confronted her about it and told her how I'd found out. She told me nothing was going on, she also said 'me and him get on well'. She added that she felt lonely (most of her close friends have moved away recently and she doesnt get to talk to them much). So I understood that, but she had still kept talking to the guy even after telling me he was being inappropriate to her.

Recently I've noticed her being online quite late at night, when in the past she hasnt been (she's logged in on MSN, and has also been on after telling me over the phone that she was going to bed a couple of hours previously).

So far all this, plus my gut feeling is telling me she's hiding something. I also checked her phone a few minutes ago and she has deleted all her messages, inbox and sent messages.

She hasn't changed her attitude towards me much. But I know her and she's a smart girl, she could hide behind a false mask if she felt the need to.

Any help on this would be appreciated, am I being paranoid? Should I wait and see if anything else turns up?"
,"To be honest with everyone on here, I trust my girlfriend completely. When we first started dating it was perfect. Cute lovely phrases, lots of touching and she called and wrote to me constantly.

Here we are two years down the road and she rarely answers my calls, saying she left her phone in the other room, or her battery died. She's not straight-forward with me any more.  I came home to find her in bed with my brother last week.

Of course I was expecting it, her tell tale signs are: Stuttering when asked a question about other guys; lack of closeness; distant; and she stopped being straight-forward with me.

Basic knowledge about your girl will help you spot any problems. Pay attention to her emotional attachment, her intimacy towards you, and her personality at the beginning of your relationship. Personality changes when someone has something to hide.

I'm an eye person, I look into eyes and examine them. If your girl often looked into your eyes  when you first started dating, and now looks away, you know something is wrong. Doesn't necessarily mean she's cheating.

How they react is the best way. The things you did in the beginning that drove her crazy, end up not working on her any more, it usually means something else was done to her that she liked better. Best of luck to all of you, hope it helps - hope you don't end up like me.

,"If she stops calling you for a long period of time, and how she is in school (if she acts weird, or not the same as before), I am sorry but she might be cheating.

,"You can tell if a girl is cheating on you because she will become very distant. She will ignore your phone calls and say she is spending time with her pals, who you have never heard off. One thing I have learnt is to just get over the fact she is cheating, but if you love her, give it another go,

Make sure the other bloke knows his place! But, if you can't get over it then split up with her or else you will go crazy. But most of you blokes will just think there is something going on as she is a lot better looking than you are or she has had a lot of other blokes in the past.

,"Sigh... I'm a girl and I'm online right now looking for solutions to something last night that I shouldn't have done. The whole cheating thing where she doesn't answer your calls and blah blah doesn't always apply.

For me, I did something terrible last night that went against my own rules while I was drunk and here I am going crazy over it. I want to see my boyfriend and I am scared to tell him. I don't know if I should.

We're in a long-distance three-year relationship, and he's the best thing that's ever happened to me. Why did I cheat on him last night? Because there was a physical attraction between me and a guy here at college that has been producing sexual tension ever since I met him.

It was great when it happened but I would not ever give up what I have with my boyfriend for it. It was stupid of me and I hate myself right now. I let myself down, and my boyfriend and I desperately want to see him again.

What our interaction will be at that point, I'm not sure. We trust each other 100%. I know he would never cheat on me and he knows I would never cheat on him. I knew I never would cheat on him. And here I am hating myself.

The point is, if someone cheats, guy or girl, it depends on your relationship with them. If you are suspicious and want to know how you can tell if she's cheating, then already there is something wrong. But if she's acting funny and you know she would never do this to you - it's a possibility that it's eating her alive inside. So, look at your relationship with her and see whether it's worth it or not."

What can I do to make my hair less greasy?,Try changing brands of shampoo and conditioner. Certain ones just don't work for my hair. Also (for me) it can depend on the time of year. Like right now (the start of winter) my hair is so dry. Even though it's the same shampoo and conditioner I use for summer.
,"I have a seemingly counterintuitive suggestion: Of course if you’re not shampooing regularly already, you should shampoo more often.
However, if you ARE shampooing regularly, and it’s not working, I would suggest trying to CUT DOWN on shampooing. Shampooing strips hair of natural oils, and your scalp may produce more and more as a result.
Search up “no -poo”, there communities of people doing this and it works for them. Might not work for everyone.
Also, use dry shampoo!!! Basically it’s alcohol and powder in a aerosol can. Spray it in your hair, wait 3 minutes, then comb it all out. It rids all the oil and germs. There’s even dark dry shampoo for dark hair! (Lol I discovered it just this month and it’s really improved my hair situation.) If it works good on my long hair, I can imagine it’ll work even better for shorter hair.
If your hair gets too dry, take a tiny bit of coconut oil and comb that over the ends of your hair (not the scalp). Wash every other day, or if you sweat/get dirty. Otherwise, shower but put on a shower cap (or a walmart bag like i do...it’s very loud though)."
,Don't put grease?
,Shampoo often.  Use a shampoo designed to improve oily hair .... Almost every brand has a selection like that.

Don't care about boxing.
I have a couple of thank you notes to write, so that's what I will do."

How Can You Tell If A Girl Is Cheating On You?,"When you first start thinking a girl is cheating on you then there is obviously something wrong with your relationship and you will notice little things, like she does not answer your calls all the time. She will say she was in the bath/shower, or left it in other room, or the phone will be turned off and she will say the battery was flat.

Has she got a load of new friends that you have never heard of before or just one friend who she has not mentioned to you? When you query her she will say that she has told you about her, so then it starts putting doubts in your head and then you start to imagine it is you with the problem.

She starts to argue with you for no reason, and then storms out, accusing you of always starting arguments. Has she taken a bit more care of herself when going out, for example: Spending more time doing her hair, wearing best clothes when she is out with the girls, showing a bit more cleavage or a bit more leg?

Never let a girl who you are in a relationship with go to a nightclub without you, there is a reason she does not want you there. Lads are bad when they are out, but believe me girls are twenty times worse.

It is very easy for girls to get noticed and even if they are not the prettiest there is always some lad in any town who will want to brag about going with that girl in the club last night. Check her mobile call history for numbers that have no names. Maybe even ring the number, and you never know it might be answered by someone saying hello sweetheart/gorgeous etc.

Only someone who is very close to your girlfriend would do this and it would certainly have their name next to the number. If she insists on going out with her girlfriends tell her you will meet her somewhere later on. See if she then has a change of plan, or texts(likely) or phones(unlikely) to say they have all gone somewhere else as it was quiet.

When you see her next time she will say she had no signal to let you know they had a late change of plans. Do not tell your mates you think she is cheating as it could be them who she is cheating with. It is very easy to catch a cheat, but you will know if she is cheating because your instincts and your heart will tell you."
,"Easy, you will tell. Her eyes will be burning a different stare. If she doesn't act differently at all, but you still have the inkling (or if she has a history), then she is probably a much more experienced cheater.

Cocky, dramatic and beautiful girls are much more likely to cheat, most likely with your friends if they are reasonably close. If you think she is cheating, she probably is and if she isn't and you think she is, then you probably shouldn't be with her anyway.

Tell her you want to spend some time away from her for a week or two (detach yourself from her because you're probably being paranoid needy and pushing her away), then don't talk for a couple of days. 

Remember women cheat mostly for emotional reasons and they will rationalise it and say that was out of their control, thus shedding responsibility. If she seems cold she is probably blaming you for her guilt (as she is controlled by her emotions).

Everyone is capable of cheating (Its hard-wired into us), the best thing you can do is to keep one step back from a girl at all times and only reward good behaviour with attention. If you feel she is cheating, then don't do all those good things you have been doing for her. Her rationale if she were cheating on you would be: ""If you make me feel as though I am cheating, then it's almost as bad as if I was"".

Remember there are some amazing girls out there who are much more mature and stable, however you will find a lot of gorgeous girls have a lot of personal problems because they have never had to grow up or be responsible for their actions.

If you have one of these girls, don't try to see the inner beauty - have fun physically, instead. They will cause you enormous heartache. Find yourself a different girl, in fact find yourself a number of girlfriends (don't just stick to one girlfriend because it guarantees you sex that is disrespectful to her and to yourself).

Anyway don't worry to much about it, If she is cheating, don't give her the joy of the chase, ignore her burn all that lovey stuff you had together (they were only props in her fantasy anyway, while she had the romance with you, she took the penis from others like a true champ). Find somebody new and don't make the same mistake. Peace out."
,"There's always ways to find out. Try to get close to her best friend, one of her best friends might rat on her friend because they see what a great guy you are.

Also if she always calls you or texts you every morning saying something sweet, and all of a sudden she stops texting you, then something is up.

Facebook is always a good way to catch a cheater, try making a fake page and make friends with her. Start talking to her, little by little, start liking her statuses, and make her talk to you. That's how I found one of my ex girlfriends - she flirted with me on my fake page, and I never told her. I kept it this way for a while.

She gave me her number saying she was single and that she likes to drink and party that we should meet up one day, but I always said I couldn't. I used a text free number to text her I would text her from my iPod when I was in the restroom, saying ""hi how are you sweetheart?"" or ""are you busy, can we talk?"". When I walked back in the room, I would ask her who just texted her, and she would say it was her best friend.

There was one time when she told me she was having problems with a man and needed me to go pick her up that got me mad, but didn't show it. She got in the shower, and I got one of my friends to call her back and ask her if she wanted to meet up. She agreed.

When she got out of the shower I asked her if she was going to meet a friend and she said ""yeah, I'll be back soon"" so I told her I'd come with her, and then she started saying ""no, she needs me, she don't want you to see her like this, blah blah blah...""

Well guess what? I was the guy she was meeting up with! My friend picked me up and we went to meet her. I texted her, and told her I was in the black car. When she started walking to the car I rolled the window down, and the look on her face was priceless!

Sorry for posting my story, but if in your heart you feel that she's cheating, then you should follow those feelings."
,"In order to know if your girlfriend is cheating on you, you should just wait and watch the entire situation unfold. You see, if you over-react to the whole thing, she might prove that she is not cheating on you. If your love is true, and your feelings towards her are loyal, than she will for sure feel guilty, and she will come up to you and admit her mistake. So just wait for the right time.

If you want her to admit her mistake, and tell you the truth, then you should show her how much you love her. Show her what she means to you, and what her existence means to you. Tell her that her love has shown you the new part of life.

After knowing all this she will feel bad and guilty for cheating on you, and being disloyal. But then again what you're considering might only your imagination or assumptions. You see at times, we do feel scared of losing someone we love so much, and that's why such concerns enter our minds once in a while. So just have faith in yourself and your love."
,"She will often avoid your eyes, and whenever you try to make plans, she will awkwardly struggle for an excuse. If she is known to be a good liar, well, just pull her to the side and ask her if anything is wrong. Just be honest."
,"Okay, its easy I have an example: When you're done making love to your girlfriend, and you're still in  bed, hugging and kissing, say ""I know"", or ""I know what happened"", or ""I know what you did"" - something like that.

For me, it was only ""I know"" - and remember, do not mention anything about cheating. Once you've said that, if she answers with: ""I didnt cheat on you"", it's 100% certain that she did, because you didnt even mention anything about cheating. Once she says that, you say: ""I didnt even say anything like that"". If she gets mad in any way, then she cheated - simple is that."
,"It is always difficult to peep into somebody's heart and know their actual feelings and desires as well as his or her attitude. Though this task is very difficult, some people are wise enough to judge and note the feelings and desires of others. Once you develop relationships, especially with girls, you should be sensible enough to note her actual feelings and demands.

Usually girls are experts at hiding their actual feelings and desires. If you want to discover whether your girlfriend is cheating on you or not, you will have to use some measures and methods. Test her on different occasions without her notice and if she does not prove worthy, that means she is not sincere to you.

Give her chances to deal with other boys freely, and notice her movements. If she is not bothered about other boys, that means she is sincere to you. If, on the other hand, she takes more interest in other boys, that means she is cheating on you."
,"One of the first things is that you will feel it in your heart. It is a nagging sensation that finally makes you start to notice things. Maybe, as a couple you were initially very relaxed together, and suddenly you don't feel so laid back around her. Perhaps she starts pulling away a little at a time, or she isn't acting as sweet as before?

Believe me, you will know if she is cheating on you: Remember the eyes are the mirror to your soul, even the best liar can't stop the eyes from showing the truth."
,The most obvious thing that you can spot is that she is really nervous around you!
,"Women that lie will cheat, I can't stand that. If my girl ever cheats on me, I'll just toss her out and check in with the next girl on my list. If they cheat, oh well - they'll never see me again, either."
,She becomes distant and quickly gets attitude. She doesn't let you see her phone and will find any excuse to get mad. I'm just saying from experience. I'm sorry MJ.
,"Well I have done it before, it's quite simple actually. She will carry her phone about with her day and night, she wont leave it lying around where you can get it.

If you are sitting watching TV, she will  keep asking whether you are all right? Then she get all nervous, and lost for words, but trust me, in the end she will always feel guilty."
,You can tell if she hasn't been spending much time with you and doesn't want to answer your calls.
,"Well I believe my girl is doing just that. She will erase texts and calls from her phone. She said she did it because she was bored. A lot of times she does not answer my calls, and comes up with dumb excuses. 

We have been together three years and only three times have I 'hit the back'.  Now out of nowhere she likes it there.  I think she has been with someone else, and just feels bad because she let someone else hit that, and that whenever I asked her, she would just call me names.  Now that's all she wants.

She would cook lunch for me everyday.  We work at same company as drivers, we would meet there for lunch. Now she is always running late. Too bad its her conscience. She will carry that for life."
,"She sounds like a complete head-case dude! If your relationship faces a problem, but at the first chance she runs into another guys' arms, then it can't be very good.

Sit her down and tell her your fears, and ask her if she really thinks your relationship is worth carrying on. I know how much it hurts, but if she isn't 100% into you, she doesn't deserve the relationship and it's better for you in the long run to break up with her."
,"If she seems like she is hanging out with other guys, then she might be cheating on you. Ask her if she wants to go out. If she stumbles or says no, or even just sounds unsure, take that as a sign. Ask her if she still wants to be with you."
,"If she avoids you, and starts to flirt with guys."
,"Well, there are a few things. For one, don't forget the song lyrics ""Believe half of what you see and none of what you hear"". That's a good thing to remember. There will be little things a cheater will do, like lying. You don't want a liar. You definitely don't want a cheater.

If you feel there is reason to wonder, then you need to talk to your lady and find out if you are right or not. If you can't get anywhere that way, you can ask other people who know her. I do not suggest you set her up to test her, although sometimes that is the only way.

In today's world it is very important to be safe, and random flings with cheating people can have you at the clinic getting a prescription for something, or worse. Not to mention the morals you would want to be present in the mother of any children you have. Be picky - do not settle."
,"Oh that's a tough one, with me being a girl it's hard for me to answer this question, but if you have doubts just confront her and say something like: ""I want to be the only guy for you, I can't share you, I want to know, is there someone else?"".

If there is, then tough luck kid, sorry. If that doesn't work, talk to her friends and tell them how you feel. (If you do break up with her because she's shady tell her as much, but don't be to mean about it, no one likes to be talked at!).

,Become real cool friends with her friends. Don't go to far with it. Some of her friends who know if she's not doing right will feel bad for you if she is. You might find the truth. Sometimes even more comes from it. I did it once. What goes around comes around.
,"So, recently my girlfriend started talking to a guy on Facebook. One night whilst watching a movie with her she goes onto my laptop to check her Facebook and sits there for ages using the 'chat' feature on it.

I noticed that she's talking to the guy in question so I asked her who she's talking to - the answer was that it was a mutual friend of ours. So I left it. I checked again, and as soon as I turned my head she closes the page. So I pretended to stretch and watch TV and then noticed she reopened the chat with the guy.

I confronted her about it and asked why she lied. She got nervous and said she wasn't lying to me (she wasn't technically lying, but she did withhold the information when I asked). Eventually she told me he was being inappropriate to her, that she didn't want me getting jealous or annoyed about it, and that she was telling him to get lost.

A couple of nights later, my iPod starts bleeping, so I check it and find she had been using the Facebook app on it, and was still logged in. From what I read I saw that she had traded numbers with a guy and was texting and ringing him and talking on MSN.

For me, I did something terrible last night that went against my own rules while I was drunk and here I am going crazy over it. I want to see my boyfriend and I am scared to tell him. I don't know if I should.

We're in a long-distance three-year relationship, and he's the best thing that's ever happened to me. Why did I cheat on him last night? Because there was a physical attraction between me and a guy here at college that has been producing sexual tension ever since I met him.

It was great when it happened but I would not ever give up what I have with my boyfriend for it. It was stupid of me and I hate myself right now. I let myself down, and my boyfriend and I desperately want to see him again.

What our interaction will be at that point, I'm not sure. We trust each other 100%. I know he would never cheat on me and he knows I would never cheat on him. I knew I never would cheat on him. And here I am hating myself.

The point is, if someone cheats, guy or girl, it depends on your relationship with them. If you are suspicious and want to know how you can tell if she's cheating, then already there is something wrong. But if she's acting funny and you know she would never do this to you - it's a possibility that it's eating her alive inside. So, look at your relationship with her and see whether it's worth it or not."
,Use the grape vine my brother!
,If you catch her having sex with other dudes.
"My Brother Cheated On His Girlfriend, Should I Tell Her?","No, you should not tell her.  It is there business.  I know its tough and you want to but it is not your business to tell her.  Guys and girls both cheat sometimes it is sad and awful but that is life.  She will probably eventually find out some other way.  Your brother is your family and you don't want to start problems.  Maybe if you still feel like telling her have her find out some other way that don't involve you or your friends or family and that it don't come back on.  Good luck and take care."
,"That's a difficult question...it depends n what you are willing to deal with personally. What your brother is doing is terrible, but horribly commonplace. Should she know? Absolutely. The question is, are you willing to damage your relationship with your brother? Depending on how old he is, he will likely get over the 'betrayal' of you telling his girlfriend the truth, but in the meantime, his motto would be to keep out! Did you personally witness cheating, did he tell you, or did you suspect it? If you personally witnessed it and you feel she might be in some danger (STD's, etc.), perhaps try to remind your brother of the very selfish danger he's putting her in. I know it's hard, but remind him how angry and hurt he would feel if she betrayed him. It is up to you whether or not to confront him or her, but you have many options. Could you tell a parent and have them talk to him (without him knowing it was you)? It's true, it's their business, but the people being hurt rarely like to be the laughing stock as everyone stands around them and wonders..."
,Listen to lisamarie1; that's one of the best answers I've seen on blurtit.
,"Come on if you say he's your brother and you care about him; you should
tell him whats wrong in his relationship. But if you keep it to
yourself, you're not being loyal to him."
,"No, you shouldn't tell her that.  You need to remain loyal to your brother in this regard, no matter how hard that may be and no matter how much he does stupid things.  Hopefully, he will eventually come around and realize he needs to get his act together. "
,"Guys, listen...... !!!carefully.if you will never commit in a relationship, please never be in it.... Being liberal is a disease that does not have cure! I meant cancer you hear???. Anytime you cheat on somebody that dsz.... Will never go. Why? You have planted a seed and all it needs is your thought"
,Don't get involved that will just create drama! Your brother will just get mad at you and that will start a whoe other problem. YOUR not the one who is at fault so YOU shouldn't have to clean up after your brother. However you should try to convince your brother to tell his girlfriend the truth. Hope this helps. Good Luck!
,"I have always been very skeptical about intruding on others privacy, loved ones or colleagues. However we all know curiosity can get the best of us at times and only by knowing the truth on some hot-button issues do we truly find peace and closure.I decided to feed my curiosity and give it a shot.

,You seem to have difficulty in MYOB?
,"You should never involve yourself in family or friends relationships unless it is abusive. In the long run they resentment will land at your feet. Besides, it's your brother dude."
,Don't get involved in other peoples business let your bro tell her it is his problem not yours

How to grow your own weed?,"Growing your own weed can be a rocky road but if you have the time and the patience for it, then you will need to take into account several aspects:
1 – Choose your seeds well. From relaxing to energizing, from creativity inducing to cancer pain relieving there is no shortage of the types of seeds one can choose
from.  Choose yours accordingly to what you are trying to achieve.
2 – Find somewhere appropriate with enough light. Whether outdoors or indoors your seeds will need, at the very least, 6 hours of continuous light exposure (natural or artificial).
3 – Germinate your seeds before planting them. You can do this by popping them in a cup of warm water and leave them in a dark place from 1 to 3 days (until you see a sprout).
4 – Plant the germinated seed in unfertilized soil by digging a not
very deep hole and covering it up. Keep the soil moist at all times.
5 – Provide fresh moving air in the surrounding area. You can do this
with a simple fan.
6 - Transfer the sprout to fertilized soil (as the stronger seed won't
be harmed by it anymore).
7 – Make sure the temperature around the plant is constantly around
the 67 degrees (Fahrenheit) mark.
8 – Watch it grow from 8 to 16 weeks. Your plant should be ready to be harvested when most of the “hairs” on it turn from white to red.
9- Enjoy!
Of course, it goes without saying that marijuana must be legal to grow in your state/country, otherwise none of the above is advisable!"
,"It should be noted that it's illegal to grown marijuana in many places around the world.  For that reason, the following information is for educational purposes only, and should not be used unless it's legal for you to do so wherever you are.
Here are the basic principles of growing your own weed.
First and foremost you'll need to obtain some seeds.  There are a variety of websites offering these products, but I won't list them here.  A simple Google search will provide you with plenty of options.
You'll need to decide where you'll grow your marijuana.  If indoors, you'll need somewhere like a closet or spare bathroom.
The next step is to choose your light.  This is really important, and there are loads of options, including LED grow lights, fluorescent bulbs, and sodium bulbs.
Now you'll need to decide on what soul you'll use.  Organic compost is usually the best choice here.
It's likely that you'll need some soil nutrients unless you're using a high grade compost.  One of the most common choices is Dyna-Gro.
You should now invest in a product such as Rapid Rooter that allows you to germinate your seeds prior to planting them in your high grade soil.  What you need to do is place your seeds into the Rapid Rooters and keep them moist for a fee days until they being to sprout.
You'll want to grow your plants in a warm environment.  The usual recommendations are 70-85F (20-30C).  Your light should remain on the plants for 24 hours per day if possible.
When your cannabis plants start to grow buds, it's time to check for any male plants (the ones with pollen sacs and not white hairs).  Discard the male plants as they do not grow buds.
Now you need to reduce the amount of light your plants get per day to 12 hours on, 12 ours off. 
Your plants will continue to grow until they're ready to harvest.
So there you have it - a very basic guide to growing your own weed.  Please do remember that it's illegal to do this is many areas of the world, and there are severe consequences for those who break the law in this regard."

I Have A Really Bad Skin (acne). What Can I Do?,"A dermatologist friend recommended:

1. Wash with a salicylic acid wash

2. Apply a glycolic acid cream(Alpha Hydroxy) to the entire face and other problem areas

3. Finally use 10% benzoyl peroxide directly on breakouts.

Do daily.

All available at walgreens for a few bucks."
,I have heard good things about this product. But I'm not a specialist in acne treatment. You should talk to a doctor first before using it. Hope this helps.        Www.proactiv.com/index.php?acnt=GHP00000&s_kwcid=acne%20treatment|2161866378
,"Hi,
I used Top Shirley Medicated Cream and it really worked for me.  After years of spending money on a countless number of products which promised to work, I finally found one which actually did what it said.

I use it twice a day, morning and night.  Shirley Medicated Cream has really cleared my skin up, I no longer break out, and best of all it has faded my acne scars.  I would thoroughly recommend this to any one with serious skin problems.

I brought mine from www.shirleycream.co.uk.  Give it a go.  I hope it helps."
,"While some skin problems are fixable through home remedies and simple hacks, for more serious problems such as acne or pigmentation, you need more than that. Acne is a deep rooted problem that requires a high-performance skincare solution, such as Melblok Home Kit Advanced. Bundling dedicated products for day and night, the kit is the only product you will ever need to keep hyperpigmentation at bay."
,I'm currently using top shirely medicated cream I have a friend who tried it and the effects were unbelievable.. I heard some really good things about it .. Its very cheap and you can find it in beauty stores
How To Reduce The Melanin And Get The Beautiful Whiteness In Face?,"In some cases, you can reduce melanin and increase the whiteness in your face by using special creams with active ingredients known as mercurous chloride and/or hydroquinone. These chemical agents remove pigment from the skin; however, they don't work immediately. A regular course of treatment with such lotions or ointments will be needed, and results may vary based on each person's original skin tone, as well as other variables.

Stars such as the late Michael Jackson were rumored to use such creams to excess - in Jackson's case, if he did use lightening creams to alter the tone of his complexion, he spoiled a lovely, dark skin tone, turning it almost bone-white over time. It can be tempting to use such creams to exact a radical change - however, you can be almost certain that your natural skin tone is really the best choice for you. Dark skin is beautiful and hides flaws more easily than pale, porcelain skin does. There can be many benefits to staying darker. Melanin also protects the skin (to an extent) from sun damage and other health problems related to the skin; the skin is our body's biggest organ, so you must be careful how you treat it. If you choose to use skin lighteners for whiter skin, be certain you do so under a dermatologist's care. At the least, make sure the products you choose (such as hydroquinone creams) are highly rated and produced by trusted manufacturers. Don't take chances with your complexion, as reversing skin lightening can be difficult, and results may not always be even or exactly what you envisioned before you started treatment.

Skin-lightening creams are available from dermatologists, and in drugstores and chain stores. The amounts of active ingredients in each product will vary; products prescribed by a doctor will generally have a higher concentration of active ingredients - products sold over the counter will have lower amounts of active ingredients, so they are safer for everyday use without a doctor's supervision."
,"Excessive exposure to UV rays from the sun is one of the most common causes of melanin or hyperpigmentation. To lessen the damaging impact of UV rays on your skin, always apply an opaque sunblock screen containing zinc oxide or titanium oxide before stepping out in the sun.
You may use Melblok Advanced Day Cream, an anti-pigmentation moisturizing day cream for Pigmentation-prone skin."
,"You cannot reduce the melanin in your face but you can wear sun protecting creams, keep out of the sun as much as possible."
,"Better not to be a 'white ghost', and retain your natural beauty. Being white didn't do much for Wacko Jacko."
,"Use hydroquinone, or kojic acid, stay out of sun, use sunbloack above 30 , use hat , shades , if going in sun."

How can I increase my height at the age of 18? I am a boy and my present height is 5'6,"This is a very valid question and there are some ways to influence your height:
You can change your posture and straighten your body.
You can stimulate your body in producing growth hormone.
You can make your spine longer.
Your genes will help you by reacting on your action.
If you are not an adult yet, you can increase the effects of each of these actions."
,"There's nothing that you can do about your height. Growth hormone works varied & on it's own. It has nothing to do with relatives or anything else either. But still you can follow some factors to make sure you are trying & be hopeful that might helps you through your growing process.
1.Make sure enough protein, vitamin & calcium getting into your body. Just a good nutrition is crucial.
2.Get plenty of sleep. The ideal would be 8-10 hours.
3.Get plenty of water daily. Never let your body gets dehydrated.
4.Do stretches each morning right after you wake up & also during the day.
5.Follow & get valid yoga movements. Which that might help for growing as well.
6.Do pull ups.
7.Also products such as turnips, collard green, green beans & broccoli known as products that might impress the growth hormone.
-All i said above, they are not 100 % helpful. They are only a ""hope"" of doing something. Controlling our lifestyle & doing something is better than doing nothing. Plus, there has been several examples that those factors & some other as well, helped some people in some way.
-Tip: Hopefully you didn't lift heavy weight in your growing age, doing heavy weights on workout in growing age will stunt your growing process.
-Tip: All the human hormones will continue growing till the age of ""25"" that's where everything in a human will finish developing. Now usually people will finish growing on 18-20. But sometimes growing hormones will not finish in 17-18-20 age but it will continue along other hormones till 25.
-Tip: Mostly hormones grow very varied. You grow some height , you stop, then you will grow beard while most of people in your age has no beard, but you are shorter than most of the males in your age. Then you have beard but your voice is not developed fully but others have manly voices & taller but no beard! Then suddenly they stop growing but you just start growing suddenly & get taller than all of them! . . What i mean is the hormones get developed without any specific routine. So you have to check to have a healthy lifestyle & be patient with yourself.
Example: I know someone being 6.0 while he's been below 20. When he reached his 20, he grown height & reached 6.4 then in age of 24 turned 6.5."
,most people stop growing at the age of 21 so just exercise a lot and eat healthy. I'm 6'2'' and the tallest person in my family by a long shot. I also have a long time until I'm done growing and I eat LOTS of broccoli so maybe that could help.
,"Height increases up to the age of 18 in women and up to the age of 24 in men. Increase in height can be attributed to the production of a hormone, called the Human Growth Hormone, which is secreted by the pituitary gland within the human body.
How to Increase Height after the Age of 18 Years?
It is really difficult to increase height after the age of 18, primarily due to the fact that the bones stop growing at this age. Surgeries and growth hormones which promise height growth in adults are potentially dangerous and detrimental for the body. However, with a few tricks and tips, it is possible to add a few inches or at least appear taller.
I think Proper diet and nutrition play a vital role in improving your height.
Proper Diet and Nutrition:
In order to get protein, carbohydrates, amino acids and calcium required for healthy growth and development, attention should be paid on consuming the following food items.
.Carrots
.Egg yolk
.Beef
.Fish
.Liver
.Green vegetables
.Potatoes
.Nuts such as almonds and peanuts
.Chicken
.Beans
.Peas
.Fruits like apples and bananas
.Milk and dairy products
**Stretching and Exercise:
**yoga:
**proper sleep:"
,"If I were you, I'd give up on this idea. Simply don't think about it, exercise and eat a lot of protein, keep my head up high and a straight posture, like mentioned above. Don't obsess over it, because in my observation, even if you grow an inch or two more, you'll never be quite satisfied if your goal is to become truly tall."
,"You are probably not finished growing.
And Tom Cruise is 5' 7"""
,"Most guys finish growing in height around the age of 21. Eat a balanced diet, get a good amount of sleep and exercise, and your body will reach its maximum height. What exactly that height is we can't tell you. Genetics will play a huge factor there. In my family the guys are on average 5'10""-5'11"". There is the occasional one that makes it over 6'0"" or is only 5'6""-5'8""."

Its christmas and my favorite national pumpkin pie day. So do u like pumpkin pie????????????????????????,"I do like pumpkin pie. Merry Christmas, Otis and everyone else in blurtit land!  :)"
,"I love pumpkin pie! I had a slice last night and I will most likely have another one today.
Merry Christmas everyone! Have a safe and happy holiday."
,"Do not care for pumpkin pie. I'll take pecan any day .
Merry Christmas Otis!"
,"No pumpkin pie today. I'm making my childhood dessert. It's my most requested dessert. Imagine a pecan shortbread crust, cream cheese mixed with sugar and real whipped cream with a blueberry pie filling on the top. I made the blueberry pie filling yesterday and put the rest together today. It is amazing.
Merry Christmas, Otis."
I hope everyone had a Merry Christmas! What did you do for Christmas today?,"Stayed home and everyone came here.  We had a great day.

,We had our big shindig here on Christmas eve but my mother was sick and couldn't make it so we visited her Christmas day and gave her her gifts. One was a birthday gift for today.
,"Lol! I have answered this question three times already and got interrupted before I could press send! ??
That being said, we enjoyed a day of laughter and watching our children be kids, feeling very honored to be their parents. ??"
,I had a great Holiday but exhausting. Tried my hand at a Roast Christmas Goose. Came out great but a lot of work.
"So, how many of you bought yourself a present? Not me!",I did! I bought me a new pair of shoes. ??
,Incontinence supples for me and kitty goodies for motormouth

Its christmas eve. And national egg nogg day. So do u juice up your egg nogg??????????????????????,"U mean do I put alcohol in it? No..
But its pretty expensive stuff. Wish I could find an alcohol free recipe."
,Nope don't care for eggnog.
,I couldn't get past it's thick odd... Texture. However if I have enough of Echooos egg nog I probably wouldn't notice the texture! ??
,"Way back when, I did. I quit over 45 years ago. I still get a quart of the no alocol kind around the holiday season. I pour a small glass and just sip it."
,"I'm not a big eggnog fan, but to those who are, enjoy."
,Eggnog is fine once a year. A seasonal drink to enjoy sparingly. It's liquid Christmas.
"With so much knowledge now about the origins of holidays (Christmas, for example came from the pagan Winter Solstice festival) how is it that Christians still claim these holidays are Christian, when most people know that they aren't?","Christmas has always been pagan and always will be. Many don't care, you can free food and clothes, bonus money, shopping aka sales and a legitimate way to get off work to visit your family and friends or just get off work, its about getting holiday pay or vacations and with merchants its about the mighty dollar. There're ones who enjoy the hoola and fun of all holidays!"
,"Let's say they were ""Christianized"". Most of the practice of Christianity was born this way. You keep what you conquer.
It's harmless enough and secular observations of holidays are overtaking the pastoral aspect more and more each year. Santa is more prominent than Jesus in December."
,"Simplest answer: Brainwashing.
Actually, there ARE some Christian sects that recognize the pagan roots of holidays and refuse to celebrate them.  In fact, it was only within the last century or so that Christmas became a major holiday when it became commercialized.
IMO, that's the problem with other religious holidays ... They HAVEN'T been commercialized.  If they were, the importance of them would be diluted - as would the importance of those religions - and then it wouldn't be so ""important"" that people kill each other for religions."
,"The Christians (and probably other religious movements too) have always adapted ""things from the past"" for their own use. It is thought that the greater number of ancient churches in the UK are sited upon what had previously been earlier ""ritual sites"", and for the same reason. The places are usually easily seen from their immediate neighbourhood on the highest ground available.
The invention of Christianity around 2000 years ago (and heavily modified since) merely changed the ritual. The next ""big thing"" in terms of faith will probably re-purpose the sites again.
As to the re-purposing of holidays, why not? Just change the perceived deity and carry on."
,"Christians don't do that,  I think what you are referring to is something that the bible says would be happening after the death of the apostles.  These scriptures explain it
2Tim 4: 3,4  - For there will be a period of time when they will not put up with the wholesome teaching, but according to their own desires, they will surround themselves with teachers to have their ears tickled. 4 They will turn away from listening to the truth and give attention to false stories.
Acts 20:30 - From among you yourselves men will rise and speak twisted things to draw away the disciples after themselves
2Pet 2:1,2 - There will also be false teachers among you. These very ones will quietly bring in destructive sects and will disown even the owner that bought them…..Also, with covetousness they will exploit you with counterfeit words."
,"Well why would it matter, the entire religion has it's roots in what they call pagan religion. The OT is chock full of other religious beliefs, the creation myth is directly from ancient Egyptian beliefs, the flood from Sumerian religions,  Most of the rest is rooted in the Canaanite religion of Ugrate. The messiah story is based on many other religions from around the region and given a new twist. So why would it surprise anyone that their holidays are pagan in origin?"
,"Because when you are deep within the bubble of delusion as many christians are all things, especially the lie, become possible."

What Is My Lucky Day For Gambling?,"To work out your lucky day for gambling, you'll need a little bit of perseverance.

Although it might sound like a lot of baloney to most people, I'm a big believer in cosmic messages.

I also honestly believe that all things in this world are interconnected - if you just look deeper into things, there's always a pattern in every system.

Feeling lucky today? If you're trying to work out your lucky gambling day, there are two things you can do:

Firstly, look out for numerical signs. The universe is constantly sending us messages during our daily life, but - as we aren't 'looking' for them - we often miss them!

Anything from the number of buses that pass you on the street through to the ticket number you get when you're in a queue at the deli can give you an indication of your lucky day.

How to find your lucky gambling day
The second, and probably more important thing to do, is to collect data about your betting patterns.

It might not be as simple as checking which day you win the most money on (often, a lucky day comes once every 3 or 4 months), but if you persevere and analyse enough data - I can 100% guarantee that a pattern will start to emerge.

Once you think you've worked out your lucky day - put it to the test. Try out a few 'safe bets' at first, and if the universe is giving you the green light, then ride that wave!

As with any gambling tactic - the trick is also to know when to draw the line. The best gamblers are using a combination of luck and brains, so to be truly successful, you'll need to use a bit of both too!"
,"Money Talisman, Good Luck Charms for Money, Citrine, Green Aventurine ... Naturally Energized Crystals to Attract Good Luck in Money......"
,"No such thing. It's all about understanding math and having a level head.
Read up about odds: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability
Understand how the game software developers work."
,"A level head is important, like Ryan above stated. And the odds won't be in your favour but it's all good fun. Hit the slots, try your luck at roulette and enjoy yourself. There's plenty of online options if you don't want to go and visit a casino."

Signs can be treated differently, but to attract luck will never be superfluous. Many players believe that talismans are effective.

What are ways To make your Teeth go crooked?,Sucking your thumb will make your teeth go crooked!
,"We all want a radiant smile.  While much of the radiance of a smile
comes from within, whether we are letting our ‘Light’ shine or not, many
of us still want a physically nice smile too.  So when we turn our
attention to dental braces, we come across another highly controversial
subject in the oral health world.
Orthodontic treatment in young children is known as interceptive
orthodontics, and it can begin as early as age 6 or 7. At this age,
teeth are still developing and the jaw is still growing. That means
certain conditions, such as crowding, may be easier to address.

      It is important to note that early treatment does not apply to all orthodontic problems; however, it may help in certain cases.
Let’s start by stating an obvious fact but one that many of us don’t think about commonly.
Our teeth can and do move.  While we don’t want to encourage our teeth to be mobile, they can shift in the mouth.
The unhealthy way teeth shift is through either abrupt or repeated pressure."
,"Not cleaning them properly Courtney and that also affects the gums, or they simply grew in that way...if you have lovely straight teeth, why do you want them to be crooked, if at all? See a dentist, there's nothing like a lovely smile and great teeth. But an imperfection or two - crooked if teeth and gums are health, then great, that's adds to character and its you."

"With so much knowledge now about the origins of holidays (Christmas, for example came from the pagan Winter Solstice festival) how is it that Christians still claim these holidays are Christian, when most people know that they aren't?","Christmas has always been pagan and always will be. Many don't care, you can free food and clothes, bonus money, shopping aka sales and a legitimate way to get off work to visit your family and friends or just get off work, its about getting holiday pay or vacations and with merchants its about the mighty dollar. There're ones who enjoy the hoola and fun of all holidays!"
,"Let's say they were ""Christianized"". Most of the practice of Christianity was born this way. You keep what you conquer.
It's harmless enough and secular observations of holidays are overtaking the pastoral aspect more and more each year. Santa is more prominent than Jesus in December."
,"Simplest answer: Brainwashing.
Actually, there ARE some Christian sects that recognize the pagan roots of holidays and refuse to celebrate them.  In fact, it was only within the last century or so that Christmas became a major holiday when it became commercialized.
IMO, that's the problem with other religious holidays ... They HAVEN'T been commercialized.  If they were, the importance of them would be diluted - as would the importance of those religions - and then it wouldn't be so ""important"" that people kill each other for religions."
,"The Christians (and probably other religious movements too) have always adapted ""things from the past"" for their own use. It is thought that the greater number of ancient churches in the UK are sited upon what had previously been earlier ""ritual sites"", and for the same reason. The places are usually easily seen from their immediate neighbourhood on the highest ground available.
The invention of Christianity around 2000 years ago (and heavily modified since) merely changed the ritual. The next ""big thing"" in terms of faith will probably re-purpose the sites again.
As to the re-purposing of holidays, why not? Just change the perceived deity and carry on."
,"Christians don't do that,  I think what you are referring to is something that the bible says would be happening after the death of the apostles.  These scriptures explain it
2Tim 4: 3,4  - For there will be a period of time when they will not put up with the wholesome teaching, but according to their own desires, they will surround themselves with teachers to have their ears tickled. 4 They will turn away from listening to the truth and give attention to false stories.
Acts 20:30 - From among you yourselves men will rise and speak twisted things to draw away the disciples after themselves
2Pet 2:1,2 - There will also be false teachers among you. These very ones will quietly bring in destructive sects and will disown even the owner that bought them…..Also, with covetousness they will exploit you with counterfeit words."
,"Well why would it matter, the entire religion has it's roots in what they call pagan religion. The OT is chock full of other religious beliefs, the creation myth is directly from ancient Egyptian beliefs, the flood from Sumerian religions,  Most of the rest is rooted in the Canaanite religion of Ugrate. The messiah story is based on many other religions from around the region and given a new twist. So why would it surprise anyone that their holidays are pagan in origin?"
,"Because when you are deep within the bubble of delusion as many christians are all things, especially the lie, become possible."
,"A small number do not celebrate pagan holiday's and follow the teachings of the bible. Still, Jesus did say his following would be few in number.  The Roman Catholic Church (Catholic means universal, hence it incorporates all religion). Constantine worshipped Helios, other names are Apollo son of Saturn ie Chronos. The Jehovah witnesses were started by a freemason,  and the freemason belief goes back to the widows son and Jubal and Jabal, ""the craft"" and two pillars represented in Solomons temple, Solomon turned to pagan worship envoking demons with the seal on his ring (see lesser keys of Solomon), nothing to do with the salvation of Jesus Christ.

Place Boric Acid, in cupboards, drawers ECT where pets don't go. Tape up holes and cracks. Put boric acid tablets and tape to the wall so pets can't get them.
I remember an acquaintance once telling me how once a month, she sprayed outside and inside all around her house with Raid and she said it kept roaches away from her house."
,You could kill a few cockroaches but you can't really get rid of them. Mix boric acid with little sugar and any of the wheat flour and smear them on to pieces of paper place them strategically all over. That will discourage from infesting your house.

National flashlite day. National homeless persons day . and national french frech fried shrimp day.. I know i have been homeless before. So any of of these floats ypur boat??????????????????????????????????????,"  Good morning Otis! I use a flashlight every morning and night when I walk around with my dog Sadie so she can do her thing  I love shrimp no matter how it is done.  And I've never been homeless, but I wish everyone had a place to call home.
                 "
,"I have a flashlight near my bed just in case.
Love shrimp anyway they are fixed.
Never been homeless, I can't imagine what that's like. I also help when I can."
,"I also use a flashlight to take my dog out at night. I like fried shrimp, and I wish everyone had a roof over their head and a warm place to sleep."
,I have a heart for the homeless and try to help .... And I'm never without a flashlight on my early morning treks with my daughter and our dog.  Guess this is one of my days!
,"What makes me scratch my head the most is how often people make fun of California for having a lot of homeless people. The reality is that had they settled anywhere else, they wouldn’t be homeless people, they would be dead.
I’ve spent quite some time with them. When I was 10 or so my grandparents ran an antique shop downtown and I would ride my scooter around befriending all the weird and wacky homeless people. They called me scooter kid. For the most part, they’re not starving or lacking food. Not in the least bit. You can walk into the food bank my family volunteers at and walk out with 3 grocery bags full of nutritios food for a whole month. What most of these people suffer from are addiction and mental health problems. These problems are rather difficult to solve since you can place clinics on every corner, but the only way they work is if the individuals get themselves into the clinic by their own free will. There lies the problem.
Sad fact, 40% of homeless people in my area are veterans."
,"I thought I answered this question! ?? But I now remember I just fell asleep to it! Lol! YAH I slept!
Anyways a flashlight is one of those things I can never find when I actually need one. When I don't need one... I find a hundred! ??
So I use the flashlight on my phone.
My heart goes out to homeless people.
I like shrimp ??"

"With so much knowledge now about the origins of holidays (Christmas, for example came from the pagan Winter Solstice festival) how is it that Christians still claim these holidays are Christian, when most people know that they aren't?","Christmas has always been pagan and always will be. Many don't care, you can free food and clothes, bonus money, shopping aka sales and a legitimate way to get off work to visit your family and friends or just get off work, its about getting holiday pay or vacations and with merchants its about the mighty dollar. There're ones who enjoy the hoola and fun of all holidays!"
,"Let's say they were ""Christianized"". Most of the practice of Christianity was born this way. You keep what you conquer.
It's harmless enough and secular observations of holidays are overtaking the pastoral aspect more and more each year. Santa is more prominent than Jesus in December."
,"Simplest answer: Brainwashing.
Actually, there ARE some Christian sects that recognize the pagan roots of holidays and refuse to celebrate them.  In fact, it was only within the last century or so that Christmas became a major holiday when it became commercialized.
IMO, that's the problem with other religious holidays ... They HAVEN'T been commercialized.  If they were, the importance of them would be diluted - as would the importance of those religions - and then it wouldn't be so ""important"" that people kill each other for religions."
,"The Christians (and probably other religious movements too) have always adapted ""things from the past"" for their own use. It is thought that the greater number of ancient churches in the UK are sited upon what had previously been earlier ""ritual sites"", and for the same reason. The places are usually easily seen from their immediate neighbourhood on the highest ground available.
The invention of Christianity around 2000 years ago (and heavily modified since) merely changed the ritual. The next ""big thing"" in terms of faith will probably re-purpose the sites again.
As to the re-purposing of holidays, why not? Just change the perceived deity and carry on."
,"Christians don't do that,  I think what you are referring to is something that the bible says would be happening after the death of the apostles.  These scriptures explain it
2Tim 4: 3,4  - For there will be a period of time when they will not put up with the wholesome teaching, but according to their own desires, they will surround themselves with teachers to have their ears tickled. 4 They will turn away from listening to the truth and give attention to false stories.
Acts 20:30 - From among you yourselves men will rise and speak twisted things to draw away the disciples after themselves
2Pet 2:1,2 - There will also be false teachers among you. These very ones will quietly bring in destructive sects and will disown even the owner that bought them…..Also, with covetousness they will exploit you with counterfeit words."
,"Well why would it matter, the entire religion has it's roots in what they call pagan religion. The OT is chock full of other religious beliefs, the creation myth is directly from ancient Egyptian beliefs, the flood from Sumerian religions,  Most of the rest is rooted in the Canaanite religion of Ugrate. The messiah story is based on many other religions from around the region and given a new twist. So why would it surprise anyone that their holidays are pagan in origin?"
,"Because when you are deep within the bubble of delusion as many christians are all things, especially the lie, become possible."
,"A small number do not celebrate pagan holiday's and follow the teachings of the bible. Still, Jesus did say his following would be few in number.  The Roman Catholic Church (Catholic means universal, hence it incorporates all religion). Constantine worshipped Helios, other names are Apollo son of Saturn ie Chronos. The Jehovah witnesses were started by a freemason,  and the freemason belief goes back to the widows son and Jubal and Jabal, ""the craft"" and two pillars represented in Solomons temple, Solomon turned to pagan worship envoking demons with the seal on his ring (see lesser keys of Solomon), nothing to do with the salvation of Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ and his brother James taught ""obedience.""
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=cUZ5xAVJhI0
http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/jesus/nonchristianaccounts.html"
,"They do so because they like what those pagans do in their celebrations even though they are not in agreement with bible teachings.  So to get around it they make the claim that those holidays like Christmas are Christian and are based on God's word, iwhch is not the truth.  John 8:32,  "" and you will know the truth and the truth will set you free."""
,"When Christ was born, the magic were so incredibly happy that they gave HIM gifts. We carry on in this tradition.
Your problem is most likely the shopping, ECT that has little if any to do with the Christ Child. I agree. Its just a tradition for us Christians, that's all I know."
,Most celebrations were stemmed out of a dumb notions and made into festivities. An opportunists saw money in it and commercialised it.
,"The bible says Shepherds were watching their flocks by night, well sheep would not be out grazing in December, so yes Christmas was used to covert the pagan holiday saturnalia,  or the birth of sol invictus the unconquered sun."

What Is The Cause Of Hairloss Among Women? Does An Oily Scalp/ Hair Contribute To Hairloss?,"Today, most unfortunately, more and more women have started to suffer from hair loss and balding, a problem that was completely associated with middle aged and pot bellied men in the past.
Experts say that they have started to treat patients suffering from hair loss, who are as young as fifteen or sixteen, a time when the girls are in their prime of life and health.
As you must be aware, hair grows at the rate of one half inch every month, and after a certain period of time, ranging from two to six years, it goes into a state of rest, after which it starts to fall out from the hair follicle. This all happens so that a new hair can start to grow from the same place, but for some women, androgens are present in abundance, and when this happens, the natural cycle gets interrupted, and a build up of dihydrotestosterone or DHT takes place. This causes the woman to lose hair.
Experts say that it is vital to maintain hygiene on one's scalp, and when your scalp is oily, it may well lead to the formation of dandruff, which in turn will lead to more hair loss. However, this in itself is not a cause for hair loss."
,"A number of things can cause excessivehair loss. For example, about 3 or 4 months after an illness or a major surgery, you may suddenly lose a large amount of hair. This hair loss is related to the stress of the illness and is temporary.
Hormonal problems may cause hair loss. If your thyroid gland is overactive or underactive, your hair may fall out. This hair loss usually can be helped by treatmentthyroid disease. Hair loss may occur if male or female hormones, known as androgens and estrogens, are out of balance. Correcting the hormone imbalance may stop your hair loss."
,"Most people will experience
hair loss in their lives. Oily hair most likely has nothing to do with it, but
it is hard to say. Some people will lose a lot more than others and it applies
to both women and men. Women who lose hair in their younger years could have
thyroid issues, which increases stress, and consequently depletes essential
vitamins and minerals. This alone could cause significant hair loss in women,
no matter their age.
Basically, some stress,
whether it is due to an illness or other not, has the potential to cause hair
loss in anyone. Hair loss is often much more dramatic and noticeable in men but
it can still be a disconcerting because it is hard to know the exact cause
without seeing a professional. Many people use special shampoos and treatments
to help stimulate regrowth and to prevent hair from falling out. Sample Hime or something similar and see if this helps."
Is it offensive to make fun of racism?,yes its not nice to do that. Like my mom says we all bleed the same color.

Hormonal problems may cause hair loss. If your thyroid gland is overactive or underactive, your hair may fall out. This hair loss usually can be helped by treatmentthyroid disease. Hair loss may occur if male or female hormones, known as androgens and estrogens, are out of balance. Correcting the hormone imbalance may stop your hair loss."
,"Most people will experience
hair loss in their lives. Oily hair most likely has nothing to do with it, but
it is hard to say. Some people will lose a lot more than others and it applies
to both women and men. Women who lose hair in their younger years could have
thyroid issues, which increases stress, and consequently depletes essential
vitamins and minerals. This alone could cause significant hair loss in women,
no matter their age.
Basically, some stress,
whether it is due to an illness or other not, has the potential to cause hair
loss in anyone. Hair loss is often much more dramatic and noticeable in men but
it can still be a disconcerting because it is hard to know the exact cause
without seeing a professional. Many people use special shampoos and treatments
to help stimulate regrowth and to prevent hair from falling out. Sample Hime or something similar and see if this helps."

Is it offensive to make fun of racism?,yes its not nice to do that. Like my mom says we all bleed the same color.
,There is nothing funny about racism!
,"To put your question another way, ' is it funny to make fun of something that isn't funny' and no. Its not funny. You don't like being made fun either. Even if it happened to u in the past, that doesn't make u right, anymore than they were.
That's just revenge."

Is Billie Joe Armstrong Getting A Divorce?,"Church on sunday was writtten by Billie Joe Armstrong to convince Adrienne not to leave him, and she didn't. They're still together.
Billy Joe met Adrienne at a concert back in 1990.  Speculation regarding their separation was sparked when the couple put their house up for sale last year, however, there are no new news stories stating that they have broken up so it is to be assumed that they are still together.
Adrienne has been asked before if she takes offence at the lyrics that Billie Joe writes and if she worries that they are about their relationship and she has said that he has to write what he feels and that he is just being honest.
many fans dislike Adrienne feeling that she is rude, horrible, totally full of herself and smug, highly arrogant as she has been seen being horrible to fans.It is also suggested that she chooses who gets to meet Greenday and many feel she has no right to decide who gets to met them and who doesn't.  One fan stated ""She is not even an offical celebrity and no one has come to see her.  She either needs to get an agent or a real job"".  Another felt ""She has no right going around in the Crowds cos most fans have not come to see her so she need to get over herself"".
Her husband is rumoured to have been with Groupies and she takes out her mistrust out on the fans and assumes that everyone wants to and is going to be with her husband.  She is mostly spotted having fans removed by security at concerts, walking around in the crowd a signings, being rude to the females who are stupid enough to beleive she is famous.  She thinks she is a big massive famous celebrity and Billie The Doormat will not reel in his wifes fat narcussistic neck in.  She thinks she is in Green Day and gets busy ""interacting with fans"" on fan blog, fan pages etc dispite the reality is that the fans are not her fans to interacting with.  Most fans suck up to her to get to Billie Joe. 
They are also rumoured to be in an open marriage and Billie Joe is seen with several different women.  They are still together but they truly need to just go their seperate ways.  It would be a good idea if that woman stops poking her nose and interfering with his career.  She is not an official celebrity but fans have to suck up to this smug, narcussistic bitch in order to be a fan of Green Day.  She is the Yoko Ono of Green Day and most fans just wish she would fuck off.  She is turning off fans and Billie thinks it is funny when she gets security to push fans out of his way.  He doesn't about the very people who buy their alubms and lifestyle. 
She thinks she is famous and does things like charity endorsements, interviews in magazines, via the web and on TV.  She is always trying to get her frigging face down the lens off the back of her husband because she think she is famous.  IN reality for most people think she a god darn annoyance.  The problem is, there are enough silly girls willing to pander to her to make her think she is an important and special and famous celebrity.  I don't see Billie Joe Armstrong waking up anytime soon.  She is a fame-hungry, materialistic hypocrite and anyone who tells the truth about their dislike for her, they get verbally attacked by internet users lecturing you on how to be a True Fan and by users who claim to know them or claim to be them. 
Why the hell cannot she just go do one and actually get on with her own career (if she has one in the first place) and stop poking her nose in and interfering in her husbands?  Why does she feel the need to ""interact with fans"" - they are not her fans to interact with.  DUH!"
,"You guys are so freaking full of it. Probably a bunch of wishful thinkers who want BJ single so Adrienne won't get in between you and your fantasies of him. Billie Joe will never divorce Adrienne, and she is not nasty. She is beautiful. And by the way, you may think ""21 Guns"" is about their divorce, but guess what ""When It's Time"" is about? Reading your comments just make me sick. Furthermore, it's natural she would only progress through his career, but need I remind you she's been with him since before they were famous? You REALLY think she has bad intentions?

So they fight. All married couples do. As long as BJ forgives her and continues to love her, you should respect him for it. You're Green Day fans, right? Act like it.

Read what he says about her.
I think their romance is beautiful."
,You guys honestly are no longer fans because of some fat cow? Really? Did you ever consider he's still with her for the kids? Just ignore her. Obviously if you can't like a band for their music anymore there is something seriously wrong with this world.
,She's a beast and he should finally leave her.  All you ever hear is stories about them fighting.  He married her when he was pretty much unknown and he has totally outgrown her.  As his popularity grew she became more and more resentful of his fame and all of his female fans.  Time to move on Billie.  You can do much better than her.
,"Whoever is the guest who posted that Billie's female fans are ""skanks and groupies"" you should be ashamed of yourself and I can not believe you call yourself a Green Day fan when you say something like that about other Green Day fans.   Nobody has ""poisonous jealousy"" for Adrienne.  She is quite unattractive and over weight nobody would have reason to be jealous of her.  Billie should divorce her before he loses all is fans."
,"No...I don't think they are getting divorced he still seems to be married to ""Minnesota Fats"".  Although the majority of fans just wish he would dump her sorry ass already.  It was said a couple of years ago that they came close to divorcing and most fans were hoping he would have just gone through with it. She is a fat, nasty pig and Billie deserves so much better than the monster he's married to."
,"I think Billie only adds fuel to the fire by being so public about his fights with her.  I have heard rumors for years about their getting divorced.  Personally, I think he should just divorce her already.  He's way too good for her.  I think she is very resentful of Billie's popularity and is very unkind to his female fans.  Besides being the ugliest woman on the planet, she is also the phoniest woman on the planet and she's very much full of herself.  I was at a record signing for Green Day this past tour.  She was walking around like she was some kind of celebrity, like people were actually there to see her.  But in reality everyone was just like, ""Where's Billie?""  She was nice to you if you were a parent or a child but she was absolutely rude to anyone who was in their twenties or early thirties and was attractive.  Any of those pretty girls she just rolled her eyes and scowled at them.  It really looked as if she was going threw the crowd to check out who was going up to her husband.  I just moved as far as I could to get away from her.  She looks very sloppy and dirty and I was afraid a lice bug would pop out of her hair and jump onto me.  I was not at all impressed by her behavior.  I have no idea what Billie see in her.  She looks like a monster and she isn't even a nice person.  If he is not divorcing her he should.  She will eventually turn off all his fans and train wreck his career.  He deserve so much better."
,"I heard that they are actually separating.  I am not sure if it is divorce or if they are just separating.  Personally, I think Billie should just leave her.  He can do so much better.  I don't think it's jealousy on the part of the female fans at all.  Rather I think it's jealousy on her part towards the female fans.  Billie has become a huge star and I think she knows he can do a lot better than her and takes it out on his female fans.  I think she is resentful of his success and tries to keep the attractive female fans away from him as much as possible.  I have seen her up close and in person and she is the most unattractive woman alive.  She is also a complete phony.   She is nice to all the kid fans, parents with children - but completely rude and nasty to all the attractive female fans.  She should take a hint - 90% of Billie fans are female.  If she keeps being nasty to them he will lose all his fan base.  I agree if Billie was smart he would just leave her already."
,"It has been said that the 21 Guns song is really about their impeding divorce.  Many people say that they are no longer together and the sudden sale of the house they have lived in for the past fifteen years is a sure sign of that.  She is a fat, nasty pig and Billie Joe should divorce her."
,"Why can't you guys just accept Adrienne? She is a beautiful woman and absolutely nice!
Most of her haters are just 13-14, get that Billie would NEVER EVER do anything with you. He isn't a perv, his kids are the same age.
Get of your fu**in' dream-cloud and get a real life, that's just childish.
Love Green Day and Billie Joe with Adrienne or just get another favorite band!
Become a real fan or stop being nasty!"
,"Well, I here its going on but it might true after Billie made the 21 guns video so if doses true that I heard(:"
,"It's funny some of you guys say she's ruining his career. How is that so? They got married only a year after Green Day got famous and signed onto Reprise. If she was ruining his career it would have been bad from the beginning.  Songs like She, When It's Time, Pulling Teeth, Minnesota Girl, about all of Green Day's love songs are inspired by her.  Billie even said so himself that he was very suicidal when he was younger and full of empty rage. It was only a miracle he met Adrienne when he did. He wasn't as confident as people thought. Without her, he would be nothing.  She's done nothing but take excellent care of him and their children. As long as he loves her, you should be happy for him and shouldn't even think about why they should get a divorced.She doesn't act all lovey-dovey in public because she doesn't like the attention. She likes to keep their love life private. And I don't blame her.  If she was just using him, she would've drawn the line years ago when he first had a million dollars not years after. She would've took it and left if that was what she wanted. They've been married for years and they truly love each other. Nothing is ever going to change that. I bet my life on it.  :P"
,"Wow, some of you guys are pathetic to be sitting here making crap up.   You don't know Adrienne or Billie Joe so why are you making up rumors?   And for those of you who wonder if she would stay with him if he was poor, just remember, they met when he was 18, aka in 1990 WAY before Green Day was as big as they are now.   Their private life has absolutely nothing to do with any of you. Yes, he is famous, so yes, people are going to be in his business, but I guess I don't understand why you all care so much if he gets a divorce?   It has NOTHING to do with you!

=)"
,"It was posted on one day that they are no longer together.  That certainly would explain why their house was put up for sale all of a sudden during the middle of Green Days world tour and just when his kids were starting a new school year.  Also when his house was put up for sale and the local papers listed it, one of the several of the fan sites put up the article.  A day later they were all removed.  It seems they want to divorce quietly?????"
,I don't know if they are divorcing but I'm so sick of hearing about this droning woman.  She is not accomplished and has done nothing of merit in her life beside get pregnant (at the time) by an up and coming rock star.  She would not have a clothing store or a clothing line with out Billie's money or his name behind it.  No charity would ever be interested in her if she was not married to Billie Joe Armstrong.  So her accomplishments are really Billie Joe's accomplishments.   As for the way the females fans are treated - it's totally disgusting.  Billie Joe needs to wake up and see that a musician is absolutely nothing with out his fans.  Billie Joe said in interviews that before he made it he sold joints for two bucks and if he wasn't a musician he would probably be a drug dealer. (This is not made up - he actually said all these things in interviews - you can look it up.)  I'm just wondering when he loses all his fan base and had to return to his former occupation would she still stay with him.  Would she have even been with him if he never made it and was still doing his former occupation?  Chances are - I think not.   She has stayed with him because he is her meal ticket and it stupid girl fans who she is nasty to who are funding her fancy lifestyle.  If he was smart he would leave her.
,I am not sure if they are divorcing or not.  I hear some people saying they are and some people saying they aren't.  I agree with most of the comments above that he should finally leave her already.  Billie has admitted in concerts and interviews that they have a lot of nasty fights.  I would tell anyone in that situation that they should just walk away . I hardly think that the fans are jealous of her.  I think it's the other way around.  She looks like a monster.  I'm sure it bothers her that her husband has so many choices of beautiful women to choose from.  He bends over backwards to make her happy and she doesn't seem to appreciate it.  He should just really dump her already.  He's career has taken off and he's totally outgrown her. He could do much better.
,How is Adrienne accomplished?  What has she done with her life other than having Billie Joe's children.   She had a failed clothing line and anything she tried to do she couldn't have done with out Billie Joe's money.  And she certainly is not beautiful.  Actually she is quite a horror.  He should divorce her already.  I am a little curious how some people on the internet claim to know so many details of their personal life.  It makes me think that you are not just some random person because no fan could possibly know details of his personal life like where he spends Christmas and details of his kid's school.  Sounds more to me like you are actually his Mrs. Or someone very close to her.  And that makes her completely pathetic.  No wonder she is turning away Billie's fans by the drove.
,"I haven't heard anything official that they are divorcing so I don't think so.  But I do agree with the majority of the comments on here that he should have left her a long time ago.  Probably around the time he wrote the song Redundant.  She is definitely holding his career back and will ultimately just destroy it because she seems to be turning off so many of his fans.  And the likely hood of Billie having a solo career or having any success with a solo project is highly unlikely as long as he is involved with her.  I guess Billie just doesn't realize how many of his fans are female and how this monster he is married to is just turning people off Green Day.  He will wake up when he sees all his fans are gone.  I love Billie Joe with all my heart.  He's a brilliant musician and a hell of a good looking guy, be I will not support his wife's fancy lifestyle anymore. Anyone who is that nasty to fans does not deserve it.  It makes me so sad that Billie Joe has to suffer because of this horrible woman."
,"I'm not really sure if they are divorcing or not. But you can't go by what you see on TV or what the media says. They claim so many celebrity couples are so happy and in love and the truth is actually quite the opposite.  E.g. Brad Pitt/Jennifer Aniston, Tiger Woods and his Mrs.  So I think you will never really know the truth.  I did see on another website that the song Last Night On Earth is actually an admission to Billie having an affair.  If you listen to the words it only states ""You are the moonlight of my life"" - someone you can only see at night or in secret.  It does not state you are my everything day and night.  And the whole song refers to love being sent to someone who is obviously not close to him.  So maybe they are not divorcing but maybe there is someone else?????"
,"Most people are saying that they are divorcing.  She was not with him at the American Music Awards and many people are saying that Billie looked very angry and upset at the awards. Besides Billie has given his fans many reasons to believe their is trouble in his marriage with all the tales of the fights he has had with her.  If he is not divorcing her, he should.   She looks like Medusa. Billie seriously has to have a talk with her about personal hygiene and cleanliness.  She's a dirt bag.  She looks like she has never bathed in her life and there's lice in that nasty hair of hers.  BILLIE CAN DO MUCH BETTER THAN THAT UGLY NASTY PIG!!!!"
,"I heard they are always fighting and their is  a lot of talk about a divorce.  But thank you for letting us know that they are building another house closer to the boys school.  I know now to stop buying everything Green Day related.  I don't think that fat slob of a woman deserves a big fancy house and I don't want my money contributing to fancy houses, cars or schools for her brats.   She is incredibly nasty to the female fans of Green Day and ultimately will destroy Billie's brilliant career.  He is stupid (and apparently blind) for staying with her."
,Adrienne will not divorce Billie because she is so fat and ugly she couldn't get anyone else even if she tried. Billie will not leave her because she is the only woman dumb and pathetic enough to stay with him when he admits that he is attracted to other men and makes out with men right in front of her.  Ever notice that she has a problem with all the female fans but never has issue with him kissing other men.  HE'S GAY PEOPLE. SHE IS JUST A BEARD FOR HIM.
,"There are all kinds of rumors going around about Billie Joe including that he is leaving Green Day and going solo.  I think it's absolutely hysterical that this man thinks he can actually have a solo career when his wife is turning his fans off by the dozen.   I do agree with the comment that it makes absolutely no sense to show a married man with kids so much attention.  I think that all the fans should give his wife exactly what she wants and leave him alone.  See what kind of career he will have then.  Let him retire to that fancy house he's building ""closer to his kids school"".  But the fans should definitely stop funding his fat hog of a wife's fancy lifestyle and kid's fancy schools."
,Honestly who really cares?I agree with all  little fan girls tht billie is HAWT.but hes also obviously in love with adrienne.if he isn't then fine yay billie joe.but let them b 4 now if you really  his fans.o and btw don't stop buying gd merch just because you h8 his wife.your ruining billies life 2
,"There are some rumors going around that the song ""21 Guns"" is about Addie and Billie Joe getting a divorce, but Billie hasn't said anything about the rumors to deny or confirm them."
,"You people are awful! Adrienne seems like a lovely woman, and certainly isn't unattractive! I smell jealousy."
,"I think he should divorce Adrienne.  She is a fat, disgusting worthless piece of s**t."
,"Well, sorry to be so blunt, but if mentioning to journalists how bad your marriage is, to earn more money, then that's pathetic. There's better ways to earn money. Like a paper boy, for example. C'mon Billie. Are you serious dude?"
,"Hmmmm...interesting conversation.  I don't think they are getting divorced or anything.  But I do agree that she's is definitely killing his career.  She seem to be the Yoko Ono of Green Day.   I have heard that she is very nasty to the female fans.  And in regards to the comment above that  Adrienne ""needs to keep the skanks and bitches at bay"" that alone is reason for Billie to lose every fan he has.  I have never in my life heard of any spouse of a rock star refer to the female fans of the group as skanks and bitches.  Is this lady for real?  Girls, listen to me - you are all smart, strong women who do not have to take these derrogatory insults from the wife of a rock star.  And I don't believe for one moment that anyone is jealous of her.  She is without a doubt the ugliest woman on the planet.  I think you should all just give her what she wants and just ignore her husband.  She has been insulting to some of you so stop voting for Green Day in awards, stop buying their albums, and stop attending their concerts.  Believe me that will get your message across stronger than all the venting that is being done here.  No rock star who allows his wife to treat deserves to have fans.  And if he is as happily married as
they say he is - isn't chasing a married man with children absolutely fruitless?  Focus on a rockstar or band that will appreciate your attention."
,"There were all kinds of rumors that the song 21 Guns was about their getting a divorce, but Billie has not confirmed or denied the rumors.  He should divorce her.  He is much too good for her.  She's fat and ugly and he could do much better than her.  And it is a bit strange that he would put up his house for sale while he is in the middle of a world tour.  He has lived there for so many years, it would just make more sense to sell it when the tour was over.  But it mysteriously went on the market in September, just when his kids were starting school and he was about to leave for several months to Europe and Asia.  The timing just seems very odd.  A separation or possible divorce from Adrienne would explain the house being put up for sale all of a sudden.  In any case she is a loser and he is much better off without her."
,"A good reason?  How about the fact that Billie admits that they fight like cats and dogs?  Sounds to me like he doesn't love her he just hangs around for the kids.   And nobody is jealous of her.  She is a fat, disgusting, slob.  Why would anyone be jealous of her?   The only thing I could say to the last response is if Billie doesn't care about losing his fans then he should.  He admitted in an interview he was not happy being the stay at home suburban dad.  So let him go back to being that or what ever the hell he was before he made it.  I think he was a bus boy or something.  Let 's see if she stays with him when he's a bus boy again.  As a matter of fact the last answer just made me think I was so stupid to be a fan of his.  If Billie doesn't care about his fans he doesn't deserve to have them and I we should be smart to support groups who do care about his fans."
,"I don't think they are divorcing but he probably should leave her.  I am just curious why when some of you said that you have experienced her being nasty to you why you still support Billie Joe the way you do.  Really? What smart, modern woman gives her full attention to a man who's wife is nasty to them?  Why?  I wouldn't give him the time of day if that were the case.  And if he is as happily married as some of these posts say then isn't absolutely fruitless showing a married man with children attention?  Use your time, energy, and attention elsewhere. Either on yourselves or on someone who appreciates it. Believe me Billie Joe isn't the end all to everything.  There are plenty of bans and rock stars out there who would love you for half the attention you give Billie Joe.  This woman has been crying and belly aching for you to leave her husband alone.  Give her what she wants, wasting your precious attention on him."
,"I don't think they are getting a divorce but I think he should leave her.  I have to be honest even the guys are sick and tired of hearing about this  whining, ugly  woman.  She is severely hurting Green Day's popularity with the women and if Billie was smart he would see that.  Sometimes I think she would not be happy until she completely ruins his career.  Billie is one of the most gifted songwriters of our generation.  It is so sad that such a genius is having his career ruined by a miserable spouse.  There was even rumors going around about Billie wanting to start a solo career.  I think the success of a solo career is highly unlikely as long as he's married to her.  I also worry about the popularity of Green Day suffering because of her.  I think most fans would be happy if she would just go away."
,"I think most of the fans think that he should just finally dump her.  She is totally turning off his fans and most fans can't stand her and are turning their back on Billie Joe because of her.  Green Day put out an amazing album with 21 Century Breakdown, but yet other than 21 Guns none of their singles seem to be charting.  Many fans are no longer voting for Green Day in fan based awards or polls.  And most fans are saying they will not see this new musical project of theirs because they refuse to support his fat slob wife's fancy lifestyle anymore.  She is already hurting his career and Green Day's success.  Personally I think he should dump her sorry ass before she totally kills his career all together."
,"Who are all these ""people"" saying that they are divorcing? I've heard nothing of the sort. In fact they were just pictured holding hands and looking quite in love while Billie and crew were in Australia. Maybe they fight, but that doesn't mean they're divorcing. Many married couples fight, but they still love each other at the end of the day."
,"I think most people agree that Billie should have dumped her years ago.  But I don't understand why some of you girls let her bother you so much.  She is fat, monstrously ugly and I don't any of you should be giving her the time of day.  I would say the best thing to do is to not give her any attention - just act like she doesn't exist.  If anything you should pity poor Billie for having to be married to such a beast!"
,"Oh my god people honestly,
1st of all if they have split up then why on earth is she on tour with them
with all their kids in tow too,
adrienne is lovely we waved at her in london at the gig on the barrier, and she waved back loads at us and smiled a lot,
her kids where also there,
why would she be stood side stage watching billie and the boys if they have Split up

they are happy together, stop spreading malicious sad gossip and grow up, they re married I doubt after all this time they re split up
so get a a life,."
,"Adrienne is the BEST girl that you can see,so I just can say you are nasty jealous because there are a lot of girls jealous of her .THEY W?LL NEVER DIVORCE AND ADIE IS THE BEST G?RL! He loves her you can understand by songs,sentences. They are the best ! Cut it out!"
,"OK so this is an old post, but I'm so angry I'm gonna have my say, as
the saying goes, better late than never.
This is disgusting,
you people call yourselves fans and you are slagging of the woman he
loves. You're all just jealous bit**es because you wish you could have
him yourselves.
They've been married 19 years and hopefully will still
be married in another 19 years and those who don't like it can F off.
I think they make a lovely couple!"
,"They should.  All she cares about is trying to get attention and fame off the back of Billie Joe and the kids.  Regarding the fact that it was a manager-led intervention last year, it only prooves she does not care about him as a person.  They only reason why the fans think she is a celebrity is because of her attention-seeking  and desperate need for the limelight because she enjoys it - doing interviews and getting flimed for documentaries and how Billie Joe seems to never get passed an interview without mention her.  She has worked with charities but as a celebrity and has made Green Day fundraise and campaign for the charities she supports.  She tweet to interact with Green Day fans and to tweet about her sons and Billie - she doesnt tweet about herself.  She is just an attention-seeker who has succeeed into getting the attention she thinks she deserves.  Stop bullying other fans into giving her attention as its out of order.  No fan should have to give a wife of a rock star attention in order to be allowed to be a fan of a band that they are not part of and milks for attention.  If Billie Joe died, she would milk his death for attention.  She is has Narcissistic Personality Disorder and anyone who can see her for what she is, are going to get abused.  And I cannot forgive a manager-led intervention.  Billie Joe should not be grovelling to her, it should be the other way around.  She is staying with him for attention, status and fame and the lifestyle.  She is also very manipulative as she has manipulated enough people to enable and back up her delusions of grandeur.  And yes, I do agree with the label of The Yoko Ono of Green Day as she will not stop and is allowed to get attention off of Billie Joe and his success and is allowed to interfere.  If she is so deperate for attention and fame can't she do it properly by signing to an agent to be an official celebrity she so desperately wants to be - off the back of Billie Joes' career?  Its his choice to stay with someone who does this and and she tweeted about an addictive perscription pill more than once and then went through her twitter deleting them..  Epic fail.  If he truly wants to be drink and drug free a radical change is needed but its obvious why he sticks with her and remember she came out of a punk scene too and was not straight edge....so go figure.  The fan shouldnt even know who she is.  Its ultimitately both their fault by letting her get attention in the first place and for being so public about their relationship.   All she cares about is the limelight and the attention that people give her.  She is not only in love with herself but in love with the limelight.  She makes me want to puke and more importantly what really annoys me is that there are enough sychophants to bully anyone who is rational enough to see her for what she is.  A limelight-loving attention-seeker using her family and grabs every opporunity she can to turn the attention and limelight onto her including all the interviews and the publicity etc -  at some point in the communication thread whether it is the journalist that drops or she allows for the journalist to drop -  publicity for that eco shop she has at some point Billie Joe Armstrong name is dropped and uses Emilys Army for gaining attention too.  Also there are plenty of Eco and fairtade and handmade artiscan shops around the Oakland and San Franisco area so why does her shop get so much attention and publicity?"
,To the people that talk negative about Adrienne have you actually met her or you just going by what you see online?.  Has anyone actually met Billie after 2012 and had a negative experience?.
,"My husband was so smooth at hiding his infidelity so I had no proof for months, I was referred to some hacker and decided to give him a try.. The result was incredible because all my cheating husband's text messages, whatsapp, facebook and even phone conversations was wired directly to my cellphone. Deephacking17 helped me put a round-the-clock monitoring on him and I got concrete evidence of his escapades..if your spouse is an expert at hiding his cheating adventures

,"You guys are assholes for talking like this. You say she's ugly, but are you sure you aren't looking in a mirror? Seeing your personality maybe? And she is no reason to stop loving Green Day, you pathetic gossips."
,Did anyone see the grammy awards? Adrienne was there and Billie kissed her when he/green day won. Still together.
,"Come on, honestly? Billie Joe and Adrienne are the cutest couple, and she's beautiful! They would never get a divorce! The way they met is the sweetest thing, by the way :)"
,I'm laughing my ass off at how many green day fans are wasting their time getting mad over this. I'm a huge ass green day fan and I think its completely ridiculous that you people take it so seriously.
,"Regardless of this woman's looks, age, or weight, it's personality to be concerned about. If she's a jerk, then she is, so then don't spend money on Green Day anymore. If she's kind, smart and funny, then she is, so be inspired by her. I can guarantee not one person writing here knows her personally.

Anyone telling these angry fans they're not Green Day fans because they dislike Adrienne is RETARDED. The fact everyone is getting so upset, on BOTH sides of the argument, shows each person is a concerned fan. The bottom line is, she's just another celebrity in the spotlight for people to disect. As Amy Lee says, ""If people are making fun of you, you're probably doing something right."""
,"Guys.... You really are so unfair
she's beautiful and lovely.
Personality I love bj and adrienne, if she never meet him, he never would be were he are now
cause she help him and love him very much
so, stoping this f*cking conversation"
,Jesus Christ peoplee theyy are never going to divorce theyy love eachh otherr if you likedd billie Joe you woould knoww that he has saidd menii timess Adrienne is the only woman he will ever lovee Therr happy andd therr a great couplee
,"Well the thing is any seperation or rumored divorce is only coming from her.  She has left him twice so far over the past 15 or so years and she has always has come back to him.  I cannot understand why he is still with someone who is allegedly horrible to his fans and acts as if she is some sort of celebrity, as if we actually care about what she thinks, feels or says.  Just because she is wife and muse of a musican does not gave her the right to act horrible, or give her copy wright rights to the music.  Her attitude sucks and she looks like a horrid drug-addled over-grown Groupie.  Being a muse to a musican is not a career option.....When she left him in May he was really really hurt by it and when he was on TV performing ""Last of The American Girls"" he looked as though he was going to break down in tears.  So any divorce would be coming from her.  It is a shame that he chooses to be with someone who is so smug, arrogant and nasty to fans and who people accuse others of being jealous of if we say anything else other than that she is such a wonderful, beautiful, kind, saintly, lovely person....etc.  We do not care.  And she seems to me that she has this attitude of ""Look at me, look WHO I'M with and your not...haa haa haa - smirk, smirk"" is horrible.  I am quite miserable that even someone like Billie Joe Armstrong will go for and continue being with someone never fails to have an attitude.  She needs to go home, get some perspective, get  a reality check, get a pair of sissors and cut those nasty deadlocks off and take a shower.  Then say sorry to everyone she has been nasty to and to Billie for acting like a diva. I do not like her, not because I am a 14 year old it is because she comes accross as arrogant and horrible and mean."
,"All of you people agreeing that Addie and Billie should get a divorce, you clearly aren't Green Day fans. Fans worship the band and want what's best for them AND their members.
Let's start with my 1st arguement.
Firstly, someone here stated that ""He admitted in an interview he was not happy being the stay at home suburban dad. So let him go back to being that or what ever the hell he was before he made it. I think he was a bus boy or something. Let 's see if she stays with him when he's a bus boy again.""
This is completely wrong. Infact, Billie Joe met Addrienne WHILST touring BEFORE Green Day were even famous! Billie Joe had been in the band since he and Mike were 15. They started the band. Billie Joe said in MTV: Behind The Music, Green Day special, that Addie had nothing to do with the band. She wasn't a roadie or anything. He just met her on the street, and he happened to be touring with the band in that area, WHEN HE WAS 19 YEARS OF AGE! Billie is now 39 years old as of early 2011.
My second arguement.
I've read MULTIPLE comments on here saying that Addie is wrecking Green Day and Billie Joe's career.
Once again, read my first arguement. Billie Joe was so in love with Addie, he had this infatuation he could not break. He got the band to tour again in the area where Addie lived, so he could see her again. This tour would have, no doubt, mad the band get A LOT more fans and followers. This was all before the band was even popular. Billie Joe, Mike and Tre all lived in an apartment together, with Tre's dad driving them in a tour bus. That is the time that Adie and Billie fell in love. PROVING that she didn't marry him for his money or fame.
My final arguement.
Someone commented ""She is incredibly nasty to the female fans of Green Day and ultimately will destroy Billie's brilliant career. He is stupid (and apparently blind) for staying with her.""
This is one of the most disgusting biased opinions I've ever heard. If I knew who that person was I would certainly strike that person down for being so rude and cruel to someone who they've probobly never even met to get a decent opinion of her!
Billie Joe is his own person. He can do whatever he wants. He can marry who ever he wants. I'm not joking, at least half of Green Day's songs are about his wife. The song ""Last Of The American Girls"" a perfect example. It is about Addie, and is also a popular radio song. Many other GREAT songs by green Day have been inspired and written about Addie. Therefore, she is NOT ruining Green Day. She was Billie's Girlfriend before they were even popular, and she always has been. No doubt if Addie WASN'T Billie's wife, Green Day wouldn't even be HALF as popular as they are now. All of you biased commenters probobly wouldn't even know who green Day were if it wasn't for Adie.
Just because Billie Joe is an extremely attractive man, and that plenty of females would like to date him, doesn't mean he isn't allowed to have a wife. I have talked to many many many female fans of green Day, who think that Adie is the most beautiful women in the world. Some of these people have even met and had the chance to have a normal conversation with her. She is a beautful women who inspires Green Day so much. Sure, Billie has stated that they fight, but all couple have their fights! It's what keeps them so strong and close.
I can tell you that Billie Joe has talked about how he loves Addie so much, much more frequently than when he talks about them fighting.
Billie Joe and Addie ARE NOT Getting a divorce. They love eachtoher VERY much. Just because they are a family, does not mean she is a horrible person who only wants Billie for his kids and money.
I rest my case.
Rage n Love.

,"I have no idea on whether they are getting divorced or not.  But I will say that this woman is totally turning me off of Green Day.  The more I hear about her the less and less of a Green Day fan I become.  I don't know where you people are getting your information from, especially the person who says they know they are building a house closer to the kids school.  You just sound like a stalker.  I don't see that Billie put out this statement in any interview.  So how do you know it????  I will agree with the statements that she is a fat, disgusting, ugly slob and Billie SHOULD finally divorce her already.  This woman has done nothing of merit in her own life and she is not part of Green Day.  Billie should lead by example. Enough about his big fat wife and more about the music.  If he was smart he would see how she is hurting his career and how she is turning off all of his fans."
,"Hey... I`m German, my english is not so good.... But I want to tell some words: I think you`re all unfair! Adrienne is his wife of 15 years, it`s alone Billies decision, if he get with her or not. I think she`s a beautiful mother and a beautiful wife. Nobody know him or her... Nobody here knows, as they live and on the face of their family-life. It´s only because everyone thinks, Billie is hot and for this reason everyone find his wife shitty... Maybe Billie is private an asshole and all he does is only show and commercial, who knows?! Also how can you know, that Adrienne is shitty? My opinion is, that the female fans are jealous of her and for this reason they set everyone on her. Let they live their life and you live your life and good is... And for the last: Who cares, if they get a divorce or not?"
,"They fell in love 15 years ago. They are still together. Billie doesnt give a s*** if you think she's ugly, unattractive or untalented. He loves her for who she is, and he definitely doesn't care about losing fans because of her. It's not like someone who actually like the music would stop doing that because of Adrienne. That is pathetic if anything. You have absolutely nothing to do with his life!

Adrienne loves her man, support him when his on tour and taking care of the kids.
Just like her, Billie want to support his wife.

Grow up and wait til you get married and have kids. Then you might understand.

And if someone else wants to tell us why they should get a divorce, please give me one good reason, not one about her looks (because that's not a reason), and you will probably find out that there is none. Well, you might finally get that you are jealous. But that we already knew."
,I don't think they are getting divorced but I think he SHOULD divorce her.  She is a nasty slob and hands down the ugliest woman alive.   I also think it's funny that he thinks he could have any kind of a  solo career or solo side project when she is doing her best to turn off every female fan he has (the majority of Billie's fans are female).  I think she will not be happy until she totally destroys his career.   The only really smart comments here is that the female fans should not help support this ugly monster's elaborate lifestyle.  And as much as I love Billie if he allows her to behave like that then he really does not deserve the fans he has.  Maybe when he realizes he is losing fans he will finally do something about her.
,"I don't think that they are divorcing but I definitely think he should divorce her.  He's totally outgrown her and she is totally ruining his otherwise brilliant career.  I feel so bad that she has turned off so many of Billie's fans.  A big thump on the head to her.  She is obviously not too bright because she should know that you don't bite off the hand that feeds you.  It's the fans spending money on their concerts, merchandise, etc. That has afforded this pig her fancy lifestyle.  I don't blame the fans who want to turn their backs on Billie because of her.  But it's so sad that Billie has to be hurt because of her.  Really you girls should just laugh at her.  She is so pathetic.  She's fat, she's ugly, and just the pathetic excuse for a woman.  Her husband has admitted in interviews being attracted to men while married to her.  Sounds more to me like Adrienne is more worried and jealous at the hundreds of good looking fans that flock to see Billie.  If she is nasty to you laugh in her face or throw a donut her way. That will certainly get rid of her.  But try not to make Billie suffer because of her actions.  He's a really great guy and Green Day is a great group.  They shouldn't suffer because of this fat hog."
,I think just about everyone thinks he should divorce her but I haven't heard that they are separating - although people have said for years that they fight like cats and dogs.  I have always wonder why he just doesn't cut her loose already.  She is absolutely hideous.  I vomit in my mouth everytime I see a picture of her.  But you never really know what goes on in a marriage.  Just the other day Out magazine did an interview with Billie Joe.  He admits to being bisexual and admits to having feelings for men while married to her.  It's there in print you can see it.   I have to think that besides being hideously ugly she is the most pathetic person alive.  What kind of woman stays with a man who admits to having feelings for men while he is married to you.  Only a sad woman like her.  You girls shouldn't be upset by her - you should laugh in her face.
,"I'd say the majority of you would not have gone near BJ unless he was famous. Adrienne & BJ fell in love when he was a nobody & they have been together through the rough & the smooth.  I don't blame her wanting to keep the skanks & groupies at bay...btw, there are kids involved here & please be aware that they could come across these websites and you should all grow up and get over your poisonous jealousy.  As much as you would love to believe they may be separating, I hope they don't and especially not for reasons of keeping the fans happy.  Do you honestly think he'd be blackmailed into dumping his Mrs to keep the fans happy...pure delusional B.S.  I too also think BJ is very hot but have the respect for him as a husband and a father.  When I met him in October he turned out to be one of the most charming, polite men I have met who is famous - guys grow up and wish him and his family well instead of your vicious gossip mongering. If you don't want to buy Green Day's records then that is your choice but there a thousands of us out there who will."
,"Everyone who is slamming Adrienne because of her looks should be ashamed of themselves. It is none of your business how she looks. Billie loves her and for everyone to be going on about how much of a fat slob she is is absolutely dissapointing. You guys call yourselves green day fans, I wouldn't class you guys as fans. And as for Billie and Adrienne's arguments that is perfectly normal, if you have been with someone for basically half your life then you are going to have disagreements. And I wouldn't say that she is jealous of Billie's fans, I would say that you guys are jealous of her because she was able to find the man of her dreams and have a really happy and fulfilling life. And if all your interested in is Billie's relationship then stop being a fan of Green day's because there is more than one person in the band and they are just as important as Billie."
,"This discussion is hilarious.  Adrienne is an extremely accomplished, educated, and beautiful person who captured Billie's heart and soul years ago.  Why is there an impression that the house was put on the market ""all of a sudden?""  How would you know that? How do you know they didn't spend time redecorating/refurnishing in order to sell it?  Have you seen the interior pictures?   She and Billie and the boys spent time at their house in Mnneapolis over Christmas and they seemed to be perfectly fine. I live there and saw them out to eat one night and at a show in Dinkytown.   I've been a Green day fan for many years and I've had the good fortune to meet them both, separately and together, several times.  For the people who are saying they can't be Green Day fans anymore because of Adrienne, that's probably for the best.  If you don't respect and appreciate his relationship with her and what she means to him, you'll never truly undersatnd Billie, or Green Day for that matter.  Hate to sound cheesy, but good riddance to you and I hope to never see you at a show."
,"No divorce guys. They are building new house closer to the boys school. If you think Adi is fat then you must have a very strange view of people......do you live in America?  As most people there are 5 times Adi's size.

Stop your nonsense and enjoy the music!!!!"
,"My husband works in the Hotel Green Day stayed at in Sydney, Australia, Billie was there with Adrienne. He says they are both really nice people and certainly looked very much in love. All the kids were with them too (Billie and Adrienne's and Mike's). This was at the beginning of December so obviously they are still together."
,"No, I don't think that they are getting a divorce but I do agree that Billie should have dumped her years ago.  I can't believe that he is even married to that creature.  She is the ugliest woman I have ever seen in all of my life.  She makes you want to vomit just looking at her.  I have heard she is incredibly nasty to Billie's female fans.  But I don't think you should let her upset you.  I would just laugh in her face because she is completely pathetic and laughable."
,"No, no divorce.  Billie seems to be married to Fat Mama Cass and I don't see that he is leaving her anytime soon.  Why would he she is the only woman stupid enough to stay with him while he admits that he is attracted to men.  He just did an interview with Out Magazine where he admits it.  She stay with him because she is so pathetic, fat and ugly, really no one else would want her.  If SHE had any self respect she would leave him but just look at what a fat, ugly slob she is.  Does this look like a woman who has any respect for herself????"
,"Here`s the german girl again... At the guest above these comment: THANX! That`s my opinion, too. You bring it to the point. I can`t explain my comment so good, because my english is terrible ;-) All these people here are unfair. And as I say: Who cares, if they get a divorce or not?????? But the discussion is amazing :-))"
,"They met when they were young, he has written many love songs, he loves her, the way she is. People should stop carrying about looks, and being so ....just stupid, ....Are looks really all that matter ??? NO, he loves her and only her. And I think she is very brave and (it's something I couldn't do)  she lets him kiss guys because it's a tradition!
....Addie  loves Billie joe! They married as soon as they were able to.
They married in like 5 minutes. IN their backyard.
They were young, and in love, neither knew that Green day would be such a success, addie wouldn't have cared if he wouldn't have been a celebrity, they just loved each other...

DO YOU all not believe in unconditional love????
If you don't...you are an IDIOT

80 loves BJ and BJ loves 80"
,"I am a woman of good taste and I LOVE Billie joe as much as the other person but,I think you should just leave his personal life alown.I mean where aloud to have bf and gf but why not him?I think he should be-able to have a wife without ANY trouble.SO LEAVE HIM alown!!!"
,This is seriously horrible. I've been a green day fan forever. I love their music and think that they are purely amazing. Those of you who are putting Adrienne down in the dirt should be ashamed of yourselves. Billie joe and her have been together for so long. Its pretty clear that they love each other. I think she is a gorgeous woman and those of you calling her fat.. You have to remember that she did give birth twice and considering I think she still looks amazing. You people who call yourselves fans and cut down green days loved ones disgust me! You definitely don't deserve to be a true green day fan. Adie has been inspiration to billie joe. I don't see him writing songs about you so get over yourselves.
,"They are still together but obviously most fans thing he would be better off without her.  They seem to argue a lot though.  Most fans resent her to some degree while others seem to suck up to her because they think that they should to keep Billie Joe happy so that he is not angry.  When I hear she is allegedly horrible to the fans it really makes me livid.  If it is true, she should know better.  Also if it is true, she does not deserve him at all if that is the case.   Oviously he is seeing something entirely different from what most of the fans are seeing.  Why can't we see this side more?? She seems to me totally taking him for granted and most fans just thing that he should dump her."
,"Oh come on I am 14 years old...And WTH is your talking about...Just listen to their music...I am a big fans of green day,, Wake up dude.....""Dreams are dreams"" ...I'm crazy by Billie Joe Armstrong....and I think Addie is beautiful....Getting divorce or not,, is it just their own problem...nothing to do with us! Fat, Ugly, Disgusting slob...Pay attention all of you,,, stand up in the mirror  and you'll see ""HOW BAD YOU ARE"" beauty is not only from face, body, from
heart either.  ""GREAT ANSWER"" or ""NOT HELP"" you are just vote if its answer said that ""Billie should leave her"" then you vote NOT HELP answer. You are not asking but hopeless. I don't think that they are getting divorce,, I think you'll vote NOT HELP, FYI, IDTS."
,"I think everyone should just leave Adi alone :( Billie Joe loves her so much. There such a nice couple, and they've been together for like, what, 20 years now? I hope the never get a divorce, there such a cute family. 
Stop being so jealous of her and instead, be happy for her! I think she's the luckiest person in the world :) 
It makes me sick to read all the bad things that people say about her. I can't imagine how much it would hurt reading something like that if it were me. And everyone knows how crazy punk rock concerts can get xD Adi is just making sure that Billie Joe doesn't have to dive onto anybody or kick his fans out like he has done a couple of times before xD it would put me in a bad mood if someone was being a dick at my concert and i had to kick them out myself. 
So leave her alone! :("
,"Church on sunday was writtten by Billie Joe Armstrong to convince Adrienne not to leave him, and she didn't. They're still together"
,"No, he is not"
,"Billie Joe Armstrong is not divorcing his wife because the King of Punk likes his woman old, fat and ugly.  He also likes his men young, thin and pretty."
,"Okay first of all, regardless of whether they are getting divorced or not, what the Hell gives any of you the right to be so bitchy about Adrienne? Fair enough if any of you actually know her and have decided you don't like her, but honestly, how many of you is that? In fact how many of you know Billie personally and can vouch for him being everything he projects himself to be in the media, behind closed doors? Who the Hell knows the full story, and unless you are their family (very unlikely!) what business is it of yours whether they fight all the time, or they're getting divorced or not?! Secondly, as none of you have anything to do with their marriage and most if not all of you do not know them personally, what right do you have to say whether Billie should divorce Adrienne and that she's not good enough for him? They've been married for about 15 years now so I think if anyone can decide whether Adrienne is good enough for him, it's Billie! Third, Green Day are a band, they produce music - I always thought that by saying you liked a certain band you are stating that you are a fan of their music, and I honestly don't see how the way a person behaves towards their fans can change their views on their music, which is essentially what being a fan of a band is all about, isn't it? It amazes me that people can be so judgemental about situations that don't concern them."
,"The fact that they have had so many marital problems is no big secret.  Billie should have dumped her years ago.  She is incredibly nasty to Green Day's female fans.  But it is interesting to know that he is building this nasty cow another house.  I will know not to purchase any more Green Day merchandise or concert tickets.  It really bothers me that she is such a nasty, fat slob and it's us stupid fans who are putting her up in another fancy house with all of the money we spend on Green Day stuff.  Billie can just do concerts for his ugly wife in their new home.  ""Jump Heffer, Jump, Jump, Jump""  ""Get those hands in the air, Fatso"" ,  ""Say Hey ----oooooooo, ugly!!!!"" If he is stupid enough to keep her, then he should just disappear with her.  It is such a shame because he could have an absolute AMAZING career and really become one of the legends of rock.  This fat slob is totally ruining his brilliant career."
,She is a fat ugly pig who bitches and whines about the difficulties of being married to him.  She looks like Medusa. He SHOULD DIVORCE HER.  I tend to think that there may be some truth to the rumors as he all of a sudden put his house up for sale in September.  It seems extremely odd that someone would put their house up for sale while he is in the middle of a world tour.  One would think that he would wait until the tour was over and was home before he did that.  The fact that his house was all of a sudden put up for sale does make it seem that their is truth to their separation or maybe a divorce is in the works.
,"This whole fighting wouldn't be happening if them darn kids get off my lawn. :v

Their relationship isn't any of your business. If they were getting a divorce, they would have already divorced now. If Billie says he loves her, then let it be. You don't run their lives.

Okay now let's all stop fighting and love now."
,"I honestly don't know. I think people are jealous of her because they are hoping he will leave her and marry them. Btw: GET OVER IT! He loves her to death and that doesn't give you any reason to say mean things about her. Even if she is being nasty to female fans that doesn't mean that you should boycott green day completely. They're a great band and just because one of them might possibly have a snobbish wife doesn't mean that you can't like them. Billie joe also isn't using her as a cover up for being gay. He's bi and he chose to marry a woman in the end. And if you think adrienne is fat, ugly, or medusa like, then I have no idea what's wrong with you."
,"The problem is, The people of the United States of America ain't got enough time to mind their own business cause they got their nose's shoved up everybody else's asses wanting to know their business.

And one more thing, ""GET THESE LIFE STEALING MEXICANS OUTTA MY COUNTRY!"", and ""BRING THE TROOP'S HOME!"""
,"Billie was with his wife of nearly 16 years at the Grammys looking very happy and in love. Get over yourselves. He's not going to leave her. He loves her and she has stuck with him through good times and bad. Their marriage isn't perfect, but whose is? They love each other and are committed to each other and that's all that matters. Couples fight. It's a fact. That doesn't mean they don't love each other, or want to get a divorce."
," would you people just get over the fact that billie loves adrienne and adrienne loves billie! I think shes a beautiful woman stop calling her a beast ! If billie broke up with adrienne he would have already done it by now!And if Adrienne broke up with Billie he wouldnt be able to write all of the songs we love so stop being a green eyed monster !! Billie loves Adrienne and we love GREEN DAY!!! Ang yes he admitted when his first son Joey Marciano Armstrong was born that he is bisexual theres nothing wrong with that ! It obiously dosnt bother Adrienne and that a good thing not to be jealous . So you people that hate her get over it Adrienne loves him,and he loves Adrienne !"

1. There are only two positions here. One that allows for the possibility of God and the other one that rules out any possibility of God. There is no position in between.
2. It's an undeniable fact that there has never been any evidence to back up the position that rules out any possibility of God.. There is no evidence now, for that position, and we already know [it's a foregone and guaranteed conclusion] that there will never be any evidence for that position. It is therefore a dead loss, and it makes no sense, to take that position.
3. I agree with all those who say that there has never been any direct evidence for God. I also agree that even now [at the time of posting this] there is no direct evidence for God. However, NOBODY can guarantee that there will NEVER be any direct evidence for God. It therefore makes far more sense to take up the position that allows for the possibility of God than to take up the position that rules out any possibility of God."
,"Yes. I experienced God when arguing as an atheist with a Christian over the existence of where God is in time. Before this I was an atheist/buddhist for 8 years. God can only enter the temple when you question all your ideas about everything you think you know, and so making space. The ego stands watch with false ideas so God cannot enter in.
The I observes the Me. The Ego is Me with which I identify. 
Enki brought Mes to Sumer. This taught man the self, mirror, make up, warfare, religion, money, etc so on so forth.

Just as the serpent or shining one beguiled Eve with the knowledge of good And Evil, duality, the self we were separated.
The hermetic or gnostic has similar story about Sophia (wisdom) trying to create without her consort understanding - Christ.
http://www2.kenyon.edu/Depts/Religion/Projects/Reln91/Gender/Gnosticism.htm
The things we are taught in church is planetary worship. However the occult or hidden meaning is kept from us and it's made the church rich. However, secular also includes the same story in there rituals and media.
The chequered floor represents duality. We came from one and now are two.
Kabbalah is seen in many things alot of celebs are in to it. You hear about the sephirah but not the Quiloth - evil tree.
Lilith rules over Malcoth (material world)in Quiloth.
Lilith is equated with the black moon
You'll see alot of singers have ritually turned bad in pop Beyonce was ritually blown up in her car in Crazy Right Now and emerged this sexy dark women, the same happened to Rihanna who often equates herself eith Inanna aka Lilith
 She sings umbrella, this word comes from latin Umbra which means shadow or ghost.  She sings it is raining Jay z is the Rain man, who is samael or satan reigning money, riches etc, 
and she invites you to stand under her shadow.

They want you to appeal to your shadow self your dual character, the subconscious where Lilith lays waiting she is equated with the Moon, the lesser light. She is the temptess the opposite of eve, she is The Queen of the Night.

Many songs are about Lilith and the shadow self, also called Layla, Lilly, Lucy.  Many of these songs relate to the midnight hour, magic or the witching hour.
The goat is equated with the beastly nature of man, especially sex. If man does not believe in God then he does not believe in a spiritual self he believes is purely material, ""a material girl iving in a material world."" He will not seek another way out and will either decine losing the battle with his beastly self or he'll die a death for the spirit is not in him. This is why John talks about being born of spirit. All men are born of flesh they must be born of God. Even some Jews believe in reincarnation and Jacobs ladder.
 There battle between  of good v evil and you choose. Jesus the son tries to shine light, promote altruism,  love thy neighbour, do not store up riches, this is because the measure of a man is weighed in the heart. 
The ancients knew about the zodiac the celestial realm, but they also believed the sun was a material object, but Gods light wasn't. We battle with our own darkness and each others everyday and some want us giving into perversion, lust and violence which is why television is packed with it, this entertains your shadow, your subconscious cannot tell the difference from a story and reality."

Is there a reverse cellphone lookup service?,"Looking for a reverse cellphone lookup? Maybe a service where the caller's name is provided?
Well there are a bunch of services that are available online: Some are free, some aren't.
Reverse cellphone lookups
Like most things in this life, if you pay money you generally get a better deal than the freebie version.
Having said that, sites like Phonelookup.com (I know, how did they think up the name?) are useful services that won't cost you a dime.
The downside is that they simply don't have access to all the phone data in the world, so there's always a chance you'll draw a blank...
Another option would be to check out the leaky bank of private data that is Facebook. You'll be surprised just how many people publish their phone details on Facebook, especially now that more and more people sign up and use the service from their mobile devices.
Finally, I'd also throw in a warning. There are plenty of ""scammy"" sites out there just looking to cash in on your need for info.
Be very careful who you hand out credit card details to."

How Many Letter Tiles Are Available In 'Words With Friends'?,"The number of letters that are available in the online word game 'Words with Friends' is:
A = 9
B = 2
C = 2
D = 5
E = 13
F = 2
G = 3
H = 4
I = 8
J = 1
K = 1
L = 4
M = 2
N = 5
O = 8
P = 2
Q = 1
R = 6
S = 5
T = 7
U = 4
V = 2
W = 2
X = 1
Y = 2
Z = 1
* = 2
Words With Friends therefore consists of 104 tiles all in all.

This online scrabble game has millions of Facebook and cell-phone users. It's based upon the traditional scrabble game that is played by forming words from individual letter tiles in either a vertical or horizontal manner.

Each tile comes with a corresponding score which is related to the difficulty in using that letter to form a word. Less frequently used letters such as 'Q' carry more points. The objective of the game is to come up with a word with the highest score. Only words that can be found in a Standard English dictionary may be used.

Words with Friends has more than 173,000 permitted words listed in the Enhanced North American Benchmark Lexicon (ENABLE). ENABLE is popularly used as a reference for many of the other word games online.

The rules of the game are similar to Scrabble itself. The game ends when every tile is used, and there are no tiles remaining. The game could also end if in three successive turns, no score was drawn for each player."
,"You have to remember the blank tiles can be converted, so you can possibly have one more of any of the letters listed."
,"I'm playing Words with friends right now, and there are 6 's' tiles."
,"It says 5 Ds, but I'm looking at a board with 6 played and still 15 letters left.  This is wrong."
,"Don't forget that there are two Blank tiles that can be used in place of any letter you need. The way to check the number of letters on the board is to see if any of them have no score value. When a blank tile is played, there is no value number on it whereas every other tile has a value."

who invent first video game? and video game name??,"More than fifty
years ago, before either arcades or home video games, visitors waited in
line at Brookhaven National Laboratory to play “Tennis for Two,” an
electronic tennis game that is unquestionably a forerunner of the modern
video game.

Tennis for Two was first introduced on October 18, 1958, at one of
the Lab’s annual visitors’ days. Two people played the electronic tennis
game with separate controllers that connected to an analog computer and
used an oscilloscope for a screen. The game’s creator, William
Higinbotham, was a nuclear physicist lobbied for nuclear
nonproliferation as the first chair of the Federation of American
Scientists."

"My Tinder app is frozen, what do I do?","If your Tinder app freezes half way through using it, that can be pretty annoying.. Especially when you've started a conversation with someone you've matched with.
Anyway, there are a few things you can do if your Tinder app freezes to get it going again. Better still, there's a trick to making sure Tinder doesn't freeze again too.
Method 1 - unfreezing your Tinder app
Double click the home button. This should show you the Tinder app zoomed out. Now swipe up on the window showing the Tinder app. This will shut down the app. Next step is to launch Tinder again, and it should work.
Method 2
Still not working? Try turning your phone off completely, then back on again. Launch the Tinder app. Any luck?
Method 3
If Tinder still keeps freezing, you may want to check that you have the latest version of Tinder. You check if you need an upgrade by opening the app store and selecting the upgrades tab.
Method 4
Now, I really recommend you watch this review of the Tinder App. It's hilarious, but also soooo true!

Where Can You Find Free iPhone Porn?,"The internet is full of free pornography, and many sites are also catching up with the trend by becoming mobile-friendly.

This is great news for porn connoisseurs around the globe - many of whom are sick of finding access to their favorite x-rated sites restricted when they attempt to browse them using a mobile device.

The iPhone users guide to porn
As a smartphone user myself, I totally understand the challenges that finding porn on an iPhone entails.

Even some of the biggest names in the porn industry have yet to update to a responsive web design (a website that's designed to be viewed regardless of your device's size - no pun intended).

This conundrum leaves iPhone users struggling to use adult sites which are often skewed or impossible to navigate on a smaller screen.

Let me tell you, when you've got your hands busy, using a non-mobile site on a small touchscreen is no easy task!

Granted, some sites do have mobile versions, but these rarely offer as much content as does the full-screen experience.

What are the best sites for free iPhone porn? Based on some unsatisfactory experiences myself, I decided to do some research into which mobile porn sites generate the most traffic.

At first, I was discouraged to find that search engine results for 'best mobile porn site in the world' returned a list of poor-quality, pop-up-heavy adult websites.

I then decided that the only way to find the best mobile porn site would be to examine published figures regarding mobile video traffic.

According to an article ironically posted on blackberryreview.com, the best porn sites for iPhone users are the following (all of these rank in the top 10 mobile video sites overall):

xvideos.com
youporn.com
pornhub.com
tnaflix.com"
,"What's the problem to open PornHub from iOS? You can easily get access to any kind of porn from iPhone, I didn't notice any special restrictions here. I love to hang at webcams like https://www.sexedchat.com/ and Chaturbate, iOS was never a problem.
Good luck :)"
,"Here is a great source created precisely for mobile gadgets fire cam mobile , I can highly recommend it. There are a lot of different webcam categories, you can choose any and enjoy live shows if you're 18+.

,"Guys, I don't know, if it`s a problem or not, but I began to realize that I like scat porn. I watch it secretly from my girlfriend, I'm afraid to tell her the truth. Is it really awful or not? Does anybody do the same? Do your partner know about your watching this shitting stuff? It is so strange but I really like it..."
,"To my mind, Scat Full Movies are what a scat p?rn lover should really like to watch, for I'd say a scat p?rn theme offers so many opportunities considering the making of such a movie, its plot, sh*t can be shot and shown so as to make viewers get excited, please do as many of them as possible guys!"

"What to do? My boyfriend was sent a pic of some girl's boobs a few months ago but it's still on my mind. I'm not sure if he's friends with this girl or not, but I've been cheated on in the past and I do not want it to happen again.","""... A few months ago ...""
Since you don't mention anything happening since then ... You either trust him or you don't.  If you don't trust him, you shouldn't be his girlfriend."
,"I've been cheated on too, so I know how you feel. But, honestly, if it wasn't the guy you are with now that cheated, you have no reason to not trust him. Now if he did it more than that once, yeah you could be worried. But I assume he deleted the picture, right? If he kept it, that would be a reason to get mad. (As I can tell you don't like the fact he got the picture at all.) It wouldn't hurt to just explain this to him and just ask if he talks to the girl or not. If he talks to her, you could ask him not to. It's your relationship, you're allowed to speak up if you don't like something."
,"Well, really....he can't control what other people send him, if it's a picture of a dog or someones breasts. Did you ever think it might be a female who wants to break you up so she can have him? Just a thought......it's just a picture."
,"I would call that crossroads. Don't trust him, maybe I'm wrong about him, but it's better than regretting it. If you can't communicate with him and figure it out between you two then there is no point. And that would make no sense to trust someone in that situation.
He is more then likely, messing with your head. Understand?"
"I have proof that mom is cheating on dad. It's been happening for years with not just one but multiple men (and women) and I don't think she has any intention of stopping, and in fact is having a guy over next week when the family is away. What should I do?",I suggest you talk to your mom. And tell her if that is really healthy for the family and herself because of what she is doing
,F your mom. Tell your dad about it. You need to be on his good side when they get divorced because he's going to get all the money since your mom is a lying cheating wh*re.
"Would you tell either parent you knew for a fact the other one was cheating? You have undeniable proof and a somewhat confession, mixed with lies.",I'm good at staying out of situations like that.
,"No thank you. It would not be my place to interfere in my parents' marriage. If there was infidelity going on, sooner or later things will blow up in the cheater's face without my help."
,"Why do you distinguish between a ""parent"" and a ""spouse?""---is that significant in this situation?"
What are the classic signs that a wife is cheating?,"Locking their phone, taking calls in another room away from you, whispering on the phone, buying new clothes, mainly sexier types of undergarments, wearing makeup more often, having excuses to leave the house (like ""oh, I forgot to get milk, I have to run out and get some), not as affectionate with you as she once was. There's a lot of signs to look for, but basically if you suspect it, it's probably true. Everyone should always trust their gut feeling."
What Are All The Major Signs That Tell You Your Significant Other Is Cheating On You?,"Well, if the other one is cheating on you then the first sign would be he won't be able to look you in the eye, and he'll find himself less confident while speaking to you about anything. He will start giving you excuses for silly things, say you ask him to go out for something may be a movie or a dinner, and if he is really cheating on you then he surely will be concerned about the other person and will not like to mingle around with you most of the times. And you are the best person to judge on this. Its your life and you are the decision maker here. So make a move after knowing everything."
,"Signs of cheating include: Hiding things from you, lying, going out more(w/o you), staying out late, any changes in routine, changes in your sex life, wanting to look good & smell good when they didn't before, anything that is out of the norm. Or is out of character for them, being distant, less affectionate and giving you less attention..etc. Hope this helps."
What are the signs that your boyfriend is cheating?,"I've been lucky enough in life to never have  been on either side of infidelity so far ..unless I'm completly oblivious ,  which I don't think I am. Anyway , one sure sign of someone being unfaithful to me would be that he would be missing a limb or be seriously seriously  wounded in some way.  There's your sign."
,Always lying and getting caught.
,He makes up excuses and works later ours but is really with some other girl.
,Everyone gave you some wonderful answers how ever I want to add in that a lot of times you DO get a gut feeling. Just you gotta make sure that it is not FEAR that you think it is a gut feeling......

How Can You Get Rid Of Dark Circles Under Your Eyes?,"Raspberries have been proven to at least lighten the dark circles and reduce swelling under the eyes. Eat a few every day. Also, there are many cheap eye creams at drugstores that you can buy that also moisturize and reduce swelling and inflammation."
,"You need to relax!!!
try getting your husband to look after the baby and send the dog to the dog hotel or whatever!
you need time to yourself!
at least take a nap for an hour or 2 a day
this should help.

Rate me please"
,I think you need to just chill out and relaz. Take some time to your self if you can.
,"Some people get dark circles under their eyes and they tend not to lighten.  You can cut slices of potato and rub them on the dark circles, or any dark blemishes. The starch in the potato will help lighten them.   Of course rest helps too, I am not ignoring those facts.
Give it a try."
,Yep. Just try and get more sleep and take some time for yourself!
,"Many of us have, at some point in our life, been haunted by undereye dark circles. Unhealthy lifestyle choices, bad genes, excess exposure to UV rays, and allergies are some reasons that can result in the skin problem. Under Eye dark circles can impact a person’s overall appearance, often lowering their self-esteem and confidence. To help address the problem, experts offering hyperpigmentation treatment packages in Delhi and other parts of the country, over the years, have come up with specially formulated creams to remove dark circles.
In addition to using under eye dark circle removal creams, people suffering from under eye dark circles can also try easy home remedies that are known to treat the problem."
,try and get some sleep.
,Try to take 20 mins out of your life and pamper yourself. Clense and tone then lie down and get some cucumber slices and put them on your eyes and chill for as long as you can and this should help
National flashlite day. National homeless persons day . and national french frech fried shrimp day.. I know i have been homeless before. So any of of these floats ypur boat??????????????????????????????????????,"  Good morning Otis! I use a flashlight every morning and night when I walk around with my dog Sadie so she can do her thing  I love shrimp no matter how it is done.  And I've never been homeless, but I wish everyone had a place to call home.
                 "
,"I have a flashlight near my bed just in case.
Love shrimp anyway they are fixed.
Never been homeless, I can't imagine what that's like. I also help when I can."
,"I also use a flashlight to take my dog out at night. I like fried shrimp, and I wish everyone had a roof over their head and a warm place to sleep."
,I have a heart for the homeless and try to help .... And I'm never without a flashlight on my early morning treks with my daughter and our dog.  Guess this is one of my days!
,"What makes me scratch my head the most is how often people make fun of California for having a lot of homeless people. The reality is that had they settled anywhere else, they wouldn’t be homeless people, they would be dead.
I’ve spent quite some time with them. When I was 10 or so my grandparents ran an antique shop downtown and I would ride my scooter around befriending all the weird and wacky homeless people. They called me scooter kid. For the most part, they’re not starving or lacking food. Not in the least bit. You can walk into the food bank my family volunteers at and walk out with 3 grocery bags full of nutritios food for a whole month. What most of these people suffer from are addiction and mental health problems. These problems are rather difficult to solve since you can place clinics on every corner, but the only way they work is if the individuals get themselves into the clinic by their own free will. There lies the problem.
Sad fact, 40% of homeless people in my area are veterans."
,"I thought I answered this question! ?? But I now remember I just fell asleep to it! Lol! YAH I slept!
Anyways a flashlight is one of those things I can never find when I actually need one. When I don't need one... I find a hundred! ??
So I use the flashlight on my phone.
My heart goes out to homeless people.

What Is Pigmentation? How To Get Rid Of Pigmentation?,"Pigmentation is discoloring of the skin that usually occurs when the skin has been exposed to the sun and has been damaged. Freckles, age spots and other discoloration are the most common forms of skin pigmentation. Some people are born with freckles while others develop them as they age and have been exposed to the sun.
Age spots, also known as liver spots, and other pigmentation issues can be reduced although you should always consult your doctor before trying to fade them. You can purchase over-the-counter exfoliating products containing alpha hydroxyl that can be used on the hands, face, arms, legs, chest and shoulders to reduce pigmentation marks. These exfoliators should be used at night time and they remove dead skin cells to reveal the unpigmented skin after regular use.
There are also daily exfoliators that you can use during the day in conjunction with sun block to help protect your skin. Both the night and day exfoliation process takes a few weeks to work. You may notice fast results if the pigmentation you are trying to fade is light.
Some people prefer to use natural bleachers on their skin such as vitamin C and lemon juice. You would apply both to the area you wish to fade.  Vitamin C also helps protect your skin and it may help reduce ageing signs by regenerating and tightening the skin.
Always test products on an area of skin that is less visible to ensure that you do not get a rash or other irritation from it. When going out in the sun, wear a hat, sunglasses and sun block to protect your skin from developing other pigmentation problems. If you have any problems with any over-the-counter products, discontinue use and see your doctor right away. He or she may have a product that is better for your particular needs."
,"I hate looking into the mirror because of my dark patches on my cheeks. I've had this ugly problem since 8 years. I've tried everything possible but nothing seems to work. Please help!!!!
What is the most effective way without having any side effects?"
,"There are two definitions of pigmentation.
1-Natural Color (of plants and animals)
2-Discoloration (abnormal coloring in plants or animals because of a disease).
You should apply a few skin lightening products and also, keep yourself protected from the sun. The sun will further darken discolored areas. Hydroquinone Night Cream is very effective in pigmentation."
,"Pigmentation is basically just the colouring of the skin. If you are wanting to remove pigmentation and have a lighter complexion, especially for specific areas of darker pigmentation, there are products (mainly creams) that you can use to reduce this, e.g. - this one here. The other option is laser treatment, but that is normally used for more specific blemishes and smaller areas of abnormal pigmention (that is, abnormal to the majority of your skin colour).

Try having a look around online for more products and maybe even go into a couple of stores to test whats best.

In my opinion however, with skin being the largest organ of your body, it's not something that should be mucked around with. If your skin is healthy, regardless of the colour, I reckon you should count your blessings and give yourself a hug."
,"Pigmentation is caused by pigment called melanin , which is produced by the cells called melanocytes , it helps us to with stand heat and protects our body from harmful radiations and prevent diseases like skin cancer

there are medicines designed to reduce the count of melanocytes and glutathione tablets can reduce skin tone"
,I have got white pigments on my hands and toes this only shows when I have a tan.
How Can You Get Rid Of Dark Circles Under Your Eyes?,"Raspberries have been proven to at least lighten the dark circles and reduce swelling under the eyes. Eat a few every day. Also, there are many cheap eye creams at drugstores that you can buy that also moisturize and reduce swelling and inflammation."
,"You need to relax!!!
try getting your husband to look after the baby and send the dog to the dog hotel or whatever!
you need time to yourself!
at least take a nap for an hour or 2 a day
this should help.

Rate me please"
,I think you need to just chill out and relaz. Take some time to your self if you can.
,"Some people get dark circles under their eyes and they tend not to lighten.  You can cut slices of potato and rub them on the dark circles, or any dark blemishes. The starch in the potato will help lighten them.   Of course rest helps too, I am not ignoring those facts.
Give it a try."
,Yep. Just try and get more sleep and take some time for yourself!
,"Many of us have, at some point in our life, been haunted by undereye dark circles. Unhealthy lifestyle choices, bad genes, excess exposure to UV rays, and allergies are some reasons that can result in the skin problem. Under Eye dark circles can impact a person’s overall appearance, often lowering their self-esteem and confidence. To help address the problem, experts offering hyperpigmentation treatment packages in Delhi and other parts of the country, over the years, have come up with specially formulated creams to remove dark circles.
In addition to using under eye dark circle removal creams, people suffering from under eye dark circles can also try easy home remedies that are known to treat the problem."
,try and get some sleep.
,Try to take 20 mins out of your life and pamper yourself. Clense and tone then lie down and get some cucumber slices and put them on your eyes and chill for as long as you can and this should help

How Can I Locate The Best SEO Firm?,"When people are looking for the best SEO firms in their local area, my advice is always to simply search Google for them
Search engine optimization is, by definition, about understanding how to create and manage websites that perform well in search rankings.
If you run a local search for something like ""SEO agency London"" the organic results that you come across should be the ones that have earned Google's approval, and so should be the ones that you can trust too.
Although not necessarily completely untrustworthy, I tend to ignore the agencies that have advertised to show on the first page for a term like that, mainly because I'd be interested in working with people that have cracked SEO not PPC..."
,"Hi,

I would suggest you to have a look at www.yocta.com

They provide affordable and reliable SEO Services for all your needs."
,Best way to know a good SEO Company in your country is to do a local search. And if the company appears in the first page then I will say they are good.
,"Lately I mostly use https://linklifting.com/help/submit-website/ and I am quite satisfied with the effect so if you are in search of a good SEO company, you can consider this one as an option."
,"If you are thinking about increasing website traffic, then an important step will be the choice of a website promotion company.
Before you start looking for a seo company, you need to decide what you need to get from cooperation:
- traffic (attendance)
- positions (just positions for certain important words)
- sales growth from promotion
An important method is to mention bloggers about your site. To connect with a large number of bloggers, visit this site https://prposting.com"

What Does Pav Mean In The Car Salvage/insurance Mean?,"PAV is an acronym for Pre Accident Value.
 

Pre accident value is an important concept for salvage firms. They buy damaged vehicles and either strip them for parts to sell or repair them to sell them as a functioning machine. PAV in relation to the cost of salvage determines whether the firm will carry out the work at all.
Some cars are so badly damaged that the money spent on collection and development of parts could be greater than any profit that could be made. Other vehicles will have parts that can be salvaged and sold for more than the cost of salvaging them. This work will be taken on by the firm.
PAV is what the firm will be looking at when determining whether to take on the work. If the pre accident value of a car is $5,000 then they will use an approximation to calculate the value of that car in a repaired state. In this case, let's say it's $3,000. They then assess how much it will cost them to repair the car. If this figure is considerably less than $3,000 they will take the job on. If the figure is less then they will calculate the cost of removing the car's valuable parts. Let's say the labor will cost $1,000 in this case. Now they will only take this job on if they believe the components will sell for a combined total of more than $1,000.
In the insurance industry, PAC is important because the insurer will pay out for repair or replacement of a damaged car based on the condition it was in when the cover was bought by the customer. If the PAC value is $5,000 and the car is too badly damaged for repair, it may only then be worth $500 for scrap. However, the insurance firm will give the customer $5,000 so that he can replace the car."
,Pre-Accident Value.
,PAV is of great use to insurance companies instead of being essential for individuals to take note of. It is in short the excess value in which a car holds to determine whether or not there is still any chance to resell the vehicle after it has met with an accident or to simply be sent for scrap.
,"Age of the car is a very important aspect which
decides the resale value. With increasing age the resale value of the car
undergoes depreciation. The distance travelled by the car is another important
parameter price determination while you sell your car. The value of a second hand car decreases with the increase in the
number of kilometers travelled."
,"Its not so easy question, and that's why I'll advise you better go to this website www.americaninsurance.com/ for example and find out there more information about that."
,"Whiplash syndrome can be a complicated
condition to diagnose. It can be caused whenever someone is involved in a car
accident with speeds as little as fifteen miles per hour, even if the parties
involved were wearing a seatbelt. The condition can also be complicated to
diagnose because the symptoms do not always show up right away. The person can
experience pain in the neck immediately after the trauma or not for several
hours, several days or up to two weeks. All of these situations can constitute
whiplash but the more severe cases show up right away.
As soon as you are injured and suspect a
whiplash injury, get a diagnosis from an emergency room physician, a
chiropractor or a regular doctor. A diagnosis is important to your car accident compensation solicitors because they need to see your medical records and diagnostic information in order to help decide if you have whiplash, if there
was another negligent party and how much to file a compensation claim for.
Whiplash diagnoses can be hidden in obscure diagnoses like cervical strain,
cervical sprain or flexion extension injury to the neck. Make sure your car
accident compensation solicitors have the right diagnosis when dealing with
your claim.
When you are injured with suspected
whiplash injuries, you need to assess the degree of your symptoms. If you have
severe symptoms, make sure you keep your head completely still until the
emergency medical services or EMS arrives. They will put you into a cervical
collar and a long spine board and will transport you by ambulance to the
nearest emergency room. There you will be seen by an emergency room physician.
In mild cases, the doctor skips doing an
immediate x-ray. He or she will feel all the muscles of the neck and shoulders
for stiffness, swelling and tenderness. The doctor will look for abrasions,
cuts and bruising. You’ll often see an abrasion or bruising on the shoulder and
upper chest because of the seat belt or because of an airbag injury.
The doctor may remove the cervical collar
and, if there is minimal tenderness of the back of the neck, he or she will
check the range of motion of the neck, both passively and actively. In other
words, he or she will move your neck around without your help to see how stiff
it is and will then ask you to tip your head forward, backward, side to side
and have you twist the neck. He or she will ask you to squeeze their fingers to
check to make sure your upper extremity strength is good and will have you move
your legs against resistance in case there is a problem with your lower
extremity strength. Sensation of your body will be tested, sometimes by poking
the skin with a sharp object to see if you have sensation. Your deep tendon
reflexes (in your ankles, knees, wrists and elbows) will be checked to see if
they are normal.
Doctors who are suspicious of a more
serious injury will begin by ordering a plain film of the neck from the front
and side. If these are normal, many doctors will remove the cervical collar and
allow you to move your neck about. If there is still a suspicion of a more
serious injury, such as a cervical cord injury or fracture to the cervical
spine, the doctor will do further testing, such as a CT scan (computerized
tomography) or MRI scan (magnetic resonance imaging), in order to get a better
look at the neck, including the muscles. An MRI exam will outline the muscles
better than a CT scan, which will need contrast to outline the spinal cord.
If there is any question of nerve damage,
the doctor might go on to order an EMG or electromyogram. This is a nerve
conduction test that tells if there are any pinched nerves involved or damage
to any peripheral nerve. This could mean that swollen muscles, tendons or
ligaments are impinging on nerves and affecting the function of the nerve.
Most people take about two weeks to recover
their whiplash symptoms so they feel normal. The rest recover over several
months to a year. About 18 percent of people still have symptoms after two
years and are considered to have chronic symptoms. Let your car accident
compensation solicitor know if you have chronic symptoms because this will
affect the amount of the compensation claim you receive. Chronic symptoms will
generally pay more money than symptoms which eventually resolve.
If your symptoms last longer than two weeks
or are considered severe, you may be referred to a physiatrist or to a physical
therapist. A physiatrist is a doctor that is trained in the way the body moves,
especially after injury. A physical therapist is specially trained to evaluate
and treat musculoskeletal injuries like whiplash injuries.
These professionals will re-evaluate you.
They will examine your active and passive range of motion to see how strong the
neck is and how stiff it might be. Your range of motion includes forward
movement, backward movement, sideways tilt and rotational motion of your neck.
They will also assess your strength (in your arms, legs and trunk), your
sensation (in all parts of the body) and your deep tendon reflexes. Any
abnormalities will be noted on your record before the professional begins
treatment.
Treatment often begins with deep tissue
massage using electrical stimulation or hand work. Then the practitioner works
to increase the range of motion of the neck in all directions, focusing
especially on the trouble spots. The practitioner can do things like pressure
point work that puts deep pressure on a small area of a muscle and allows the
muscle to “release” and be less tense. Strengthening exercises are done to get
your muscle tone back in a more normal way and things like ice and heat are
used to relieve inflammation. In more serious cases, a physiatrist might inject
a muscle with hydrocortisone fluid in order to break down the inflammation in
that particular muscle. That sort of treatment helps but is rarely done because
whiplash involves such a large area of the neck."
How can I burn videos to DVD?,"If you want to burn videos to a DVD the first thing you need to check is that your computer has a DVD-RW drive. Most modern computers do, unless you have a netbook (one of the smaller laptops which don't have CD/DVD drives).
Next you will need to download some DVD burning software. There are lots of different options out there, but they all do pretty much the same thing, and you shouldn't need to pay for it, the free ones should do everything you need.
I have a mac, and use iDVD as it integrates nicely with iTunes, iPhoto etc.
If you have a Windows machine, a good one is ImgBurn, which again is free, and really easy to use.
""How"" you actually do it will depend on which software you have, but it is usually as straight forward as selecting the file you want to burn and clicking Go.
There will be different options in terms of quality and file type, I wouldn't worry about this too much unless you are very concerned with the movie looking incredible when you play it on your TV.
To be honest, if you want to burn a movie on to one standard DVD, you aren't going to get HD quality anyway.

Then later on, me and Jerry were throwing out trash together and Jerry said something about a new manager that just started. And I admitted that the new manager was pretty attractive. He started laughing and then asked me to rank the guys who work here. I started off with the cute new manager, then when I was around 3rd place, Jerry was like, ""3rd is my friend Adam?""  

Later on, a customer hit on me while me and Jerry were on break. And I turned him down. I later told Jerry it was because the customer was too old for me and my limit was 20 years old to 27. Then Jerry said ""No. It's 18 to 27"".  

Does Jerry know I like Adam? Or did Adam say anything about me to Jerry? I don't think I've made it Obvious that I like Adam.
Also. On two occasions, Adam stood really close to me. Like, I could feel his chest on my shoulder.

About to kiss my girlfriend on the lips but she quickly turned her head. What does that mean? Too soon?,Yep
,Look at your last three questions. You went from just dating to her being your girlfriend and you haven't even kissed her. Slow down dude.
,"Listerine ?
Might be too soon. This is a difficult question to answer."
,"As we don't really have much background, we can't answer FULLY but yeahhhhh it sounds like you went in too soon."
,Break up! She deserves better!
,Asked and answered councilor!
My Wife Has A White Crusty Substance In Her Panties When She Puts Them In The Washing Machine When I Asked Her About It She Said All Women Leak A Small Amount Of This Is This True.?,YES! It is completely normal;) This is called Vaginal Discharge. Some woman have a lot more than others. And some have to change there underware during the day to heavy discharge and wet underware! Other woman which are very and I mean VERY lucky don't even leave a speck on their panties because they discharge less or practically nothing at all. But if you want to feel better about this simply ask your doctor and he will tell you. The fact that you said WHITE in color is all you need to rule out anything else that could of crossed your mind;) I wish you a beautiful marriage and blessed be.
,"The last answer is right, but if you are still not sure, smell it. Know it sounds disgusting, but if it was from sex, then there would be a different smell"
,Yes it's true but to prevent panties from having that stain it's best to wear a panty liner.  I do.
,"Totally normal, think of it as natural lubrication. Also aids in getting pregnant, i.e. Great environment for your sperm to live, swim in, and up.  Might be more when she ovulates."
,"Yeah it is true as far as I know, that is why panty liners were invented"
,"Dude, what are you complaining about?  If your wife comes home with her panties full of goodies (assuming they don't include some guy's junk), she is bringing you a real treat.  You should seize that opportunity to savor the heady bouquet that has been distilled for you throughout the day.  Some guys actually end up paying for this, and you've got it right there in your hamper.  : )"
,I don't know the exact name for it but women pass it out to clean their insides.  They also pass it when they are sexually aroused.  That's how we clean ourselves.
,"Yes it is trust me don't worry!! And don't listen to that dude, like he would know lol. Its normal"
,You need to know if he or she really cheats  so you can be certain about your thoughts.  You contact Smith via his gmail account( Williamsdhackghost at gmail..com) I'm sure he'd help. I once had a similar problem so I got in contact with him and he got me what I needed to know within hours
,"I always check my wife's panties. I nearly always find a ""honey spot"" but never anything like dried cum"
,"Egads , quite the question there.  Well, women, unlike men, are moist in that area and need to breathe as they say, expose to air.  This is quite normal, as well, when a woman is ovulating or nearing a period, there will be mild secretions, heavier than normal.  Not to worry, only normal.  I use panty liners, because at my age, when I cough, I sometimes pee a little as well.  It's hard being a woman"
,It is true
,I'd be licking it clean.
,Because she's been having wild and crazy sex on the photocopier and water fountain.  Oh my god give her a break.....it's a normal female bodily function.  Why do men have skid marks in their underwear?
,Because there's this hot guy at work that makes her wet. She's probrably flowing like niagra when shes around him... Get a life loser!  There a more serious issues you need to be concerned about like why are you checking out your wifes panties. If she's going to bang some guy it'll happen and there's nothing you're going to do to stop it. Lose the jealousy and your relationship will be much better. If there's no trust there's no relationship.
,"No dude, she is cheating on you. That is the result of some large dude blowing his load up in her. I would start worrying about it and I would worry about the kids calling him daddy."
My girlfriend came home with really wet knickers after a night out. What has she been up too?,She probably saw some hot guys and creamed in her panties...Either that or she went to a chippandales show and got all wet staring at the guys in thongs shakin their dongs...More than likely it's one of the two...
,"You need to really check her phone and social media accounts to know what she's been up to lately. I once had a similar issue but I came in contact with a professional who helped me out, his name is Smith. You can contact him on his gmail account( Williamsdhackghost at gmail..com) I'm sure he'd help"
,"Well if you don't know maybe she pee'd herself laughing at her gormless boyfriend at home,"
,Der I don't know if you don't know but maybe she went swimming in the river.
My Girlfriend Came Home With Very Wet Knickers And Bruises To The Front Of Her Thighs. She Said She Had Stayed At Her Friends All Night. Do You Think She Is Having An Affair?,"Based on the circumstances you've described, I can see why you'd have suspicions.

Whilst the signs that she's cheating might be there, though, I wouldn't jump to conclusions just yet.

I would recommend sitting down and talking to your girlfriend frankly.

My girlfriend comes home with wet knickers The first issue to address is her wet underwear.

As I'm sure you're aware, there are a number of reasons why a woman's undergarments might be wet.

Yes, sexual excitement or activity does cause females to produce natural lubricants down below - but the dampness in her underwear could also be down to:

urine
menstruation
the vagina naturally cleaning itself out (this might also cause a white discharge)
sweating
infection
Just thinking about it for a second, it'd make sense that your partner might be too embarrassed to tell you that one of the above was the cause of her dampness.

My girlfriend comes home with bruises on her thighs

If your girlfriend has bruises on her thighs, it can be easy to assume that she's been having rough sex with some stranger behind your back.

But before you start thinking the worst, take some time to consider the following:

She may have fallen and injured herself
She many have been sexually assaulted
As far as sexual assault goes, it is very possible that your girlfriend might not want divulge that kind of information to you straight away.

Before you go accusing her of infidelity, I'd make 100% sure that she hasn't been raped or seriously sexually-assaulted.

How would you feel if something like that happened to you, and then you came home and were accused of cheating?

As far as infidelity goes, you'll never know unless you either catch her in the act - or she confesses.

So, the only real way you'll know is by letting her do her thing and following her - or you could try sitting and talking to her like an adult."
,"I think there's something she's not telling you, but don't push her."
,I agree with Kazza1994. Although there is probably a very logical reason for her to come home in that state. You might just be jumping to conclusions. Just let her know you are there for her.
,I think she may have been assaulted and is afraid to tell anyone.  Most rapes are not reported.  You should just let her know you're there for her.
,You need to know if he or she really cheats  so you can be certain about your thoughts.  You contact Smith via his gmail account( Williamsdhackghost at gmail..com) i'm sure he'd help
,"I had trust issues and doubted my spouse for a very long time. I tried spying on his phone using some apps but I wasn't successful until I contacted a very good hacker.He spied on my husband,got access to his text messages, call records, what's app, Viber e.t.c and exposed his infidelity,contact him via mail at cyberblackhat9 (at) gmail (dot) com.He does a great job."
,"If you need to check your partner’s sincerity , track his current location with gps, employee’s honesty,recover your email passwords,social networks(i.e Facebook,Twitter,IG),change your school grades,clear your criminal records, gain access to bank accounts contact rostovinvestigators-at-gmail com…he helped me catch my cheating spouse, I referred him to 4 friends who can’t stop thanking me"
"My girlfriend had to talk to her ex over the phone and me and her were on skype and she muted her voice, what do you guys think of this? Is this a red flag she might be cheating?",Why don't you ask her why she muted herself? You won't know until you ask her and then you can determine if she is telling the truth. Don't place more significance on it until you ask her about it.
,Maybe she thought a conversation between her and another persdon was  it was none of your bisiness.

What polycarbonate kayaks are?,"First off, polycarbonate is a material that is made up of thermoplastic polymers that are made up of carbonate groups. They are easy to shape and mold into any design and it is a very strong, tough material, which makes it great for kayaks. Kayaks made from polycarbonate are often made using a clear, see-through design. Some of the best sit-on-top kayaks are made from polycarbonate but other designs are made using this type of material."

How Do I Know If My Ex-Boyfriend Still Has Feelings For Me?,"Common feelings after a break up
After a break-up, it is likely that it will take you both some time to move on. Feelings don't just stop overnight, and it is likely that you both feel a degree of confusion.

Of course, it can depend on how long you have been dating for, but many people say that it takes a month for every year you were together for the feelings to subside.

Many of the things involved with being in a relationship become habits, and many people find that these are what they miss the most after a separation. However, with this can come the freedom of doing things that you enjoy again, or getting in touch with old friends with whom you had lost touch.

But how do I know if my ex still has feelings for me?
I assume you're asking this question as you still have feelings for your ex yourself. If your break-up is quite recent, the answer is probably that he or she does still have feelings for you - but that doesn't mean that they are necessarily the sort of feelings that are conducive to getting back together.

It might just be that your ex still feels physically-attracted to you, and many people find that this can be the hardest part of the relationship to get over. Normally, people only truly move on when one of them meets someone else and starts a new physical relationship.

The main way to tell if your ex is still thinking about you, is if he or she finds ways to talk to you or text you, maybe about something totally irrelevant, just to have some communication with you. This should be treated as them 'keeping their foot in the door', which you might want to go along with, if there is any chance of you getting back together.

Other signs that your ex has feelings for you could be that he or she turns up in places where you always go, or starts making friends with your friends in a bid to know what you're doing and whether you have someone new in your life yet.

What does it mean if my ex still has feelings for me?
It means that they haven't totally moved on, but it might not mean that they want to start up the relationship again. Sometimes, people love each other but, because of other circumstances (like distance, or family commitments) they break up, and then the feelings definitely don't go straight away.

Because of the emotions involved, some people find that a clear break-up with no communication is much simpler and cleaner, and causes less pain in the long-term.

The majority of people would say that it is virtually impossible to stay friends with your ex, especially if both of you still have feelings for each other, or doubts about whether you should have broken up in the first place."
,"How do I know if my ex still has feelings for me? He still hugs me.

I'm in the same situation. I still care about him and there is a part of me that still loves him too.

After we broke up he sent me a message saying he will still love me and still think about me, but when we are at school we act like we don't know each other and it hurts. I want to talk to him but I can't and it sucks I want us to be at least friends."
,"I can relate to your situation. If you care about someone, and it doesn't work out, there is nothing wrong with still caring about them. People say I'm stupid for still loving my ex, but just because I love her doesn't mean she will ever get or even deserves my heart again. But there is nothing wrong with at least being friends, if you can.

I would call him up or e-mail him and ask him some questions. I would recommend e-mail if he has one, because for some reason people always seem to talk more freely through e-mail.

Anyway, good luck."
,"I think my ex still has feelngs for me, he hugs me and he always knows how to make me smile. He seeks for attention but I think being friends the only way things get better, but if you want to get back with your ex it's okay, but just think before you do it."
,"I can totally relate. I may only be 14, but I went out with this boy, and we broke up about a year and a half ago. He's exactly the same. We were complete opposites, and now we don't ever look at each other.

I think that he thinks it's still awkward and he wants to leave it a little longer between you so that you can both have you own space and slowly become friends again. Maybe not best friends but at least friends."
,"Well, mine broke up with me about a month ago. Since then he was texting me and still seeing me. I was thinking he was getting better and thinking about going back out with me again until he got back from his holiday and started seeing someone else.

He claimed that he didn't love me any more. It's just that we had a pretty strong relationship that lasted 18 months and in the end it only took him a month to move on after 'he'd been playing with words'.

What I really wonder now is that if he really loved me when we were in a relationship, because it didn't take him very long to get over me. It's even worse that I may have said something over Twitter and that caused him to have a go at me and say that he doesn't care, which I then calmly explained and that he said it would taken a long time to forgive.

The hardest part is watching him behave in the same way to her as he did with me - you don't feel special anymore. He acts like we didn't have anything together, but we did."
,"So many answers on this page miss the obvious: why don't you just sit down and talk to him about it? You were in a relationship together once, can't you at least have a truthful conversation anymore?
Just look into his eyes and ask him and you will know before he even says a word"
,"I can relate.... I and my boyfriend have been dating for four months,,,and I've broke up for a reason that I was not understanding according to him...he once in anger proposed his best friend whom i envied coz i felt she took my place....he promised he would tell her the truth but started falling for her for a silly reson that I didn't undrstand,,,,
How am I to understand wen he didn't tell this gsl the truth...it was very difficult for me take that he is now with someone else"

How Do I Know If Someone Is Lying To Me Over Text? And Over The Phone?,Unfortunately you can't. Take everything they say with a pinch of salt if they are strangers.
,You would never no but it is very unsafe for you to me text someone you don't no a lot of ppl ask me for my cell phone number but I just say I don't have one
How Can I Tell If Someone Is Lying?,"Lying tends to cause physical tells to arise, little unncessary signals that arise, such as twitches, changes of eye direction and scratching, biting the lip or other some such things.

If you look into someone's eyes, they will tend to look to their right when they are remembering or being honest and they will tend to access their creativity by looking up and left or simply left when lying.

Liars tend to blink more, don't know why, perhaps it's the pressure.

A forced smile does not engage the entire face, it's simply moving the muscles of the mouth. A real smile is emotionally engaged and muscles of the entire face come into play.

Someone avoiding the question is often telling the truth, but only because then they don't have to lie. For instance, Did you steal the ring? I've got plenty of money. Or Did you see it happen? I'm just minding my own business."

,"Wow. Deleting the history from the computer makes him look guilty. This doesn't necessary mean he is cheating; he could have some type of fetish he is ashamed of that anonymous women cater to. Best bet would be to discuss the issue calmly and let him know you're willing to spice up the relationship. If that does not work, you may have a bigger problem on your hands."

What Are The Good Things Of Euthanasia?,"Well, if you have an incurable disease, when treatment won't help you at all, you can use euthanasia, and it won't lead you into doing suicide"
How Do I Hack Into Someones Tagged Account?,"There is a website that will give you step-by-step guides to hacking into accounts, especially social networking sites like MySpace, Facebook and Tagged. This website is www.lameass.com. It is not advisable to hack into accounts, though, as it is not ethical and is also illegal.

Tagged is a social networking site that was launched in 2004. Users can register for free and can then customise their profile page by uploading photographs, posting information about their interests and posting status updates. The site contains visual chat rooms, and enables users to send ""winks"" to each other.

Tagged was named as the most annoying website in 2009 by Time Magazine. This was largely due to the fact that e-mails were sent to large numbers of people who were not registered on Tagged to try and encourage them to join the site. Andrew Cuomo, the New York State Attorney General decided to sue Tagged in 2009 due to this marketing strategy and the case was settled with Tagged agreeing to pay $500,000 and promising to change their marketing strategies.

Tagged currently has an estimated 6 million US users and over 20 million users worldwide. One country where Tagged is no longer available is Qatar, who blocked the site due to them not being able to filter what they classed as ""inappropriate content”. There are some concerns in that the site shows user e-mail addresses and the site is very popular with teens. The demographic of the site seems to be shifting, though, as the age group with the most Tagged users is now the 35-49 age group.

When signing up for Tagged, the site says it will e-mail you about new users on the site. As a site Tagged is very similar in appearance to Facebook."

What Is Mercy Killing?,"Mercy killing is defined as the killing of one person by another. The victim of mercy killing is normally in the vegetable state or has an injury or illness that cannot be cured, as it is usually in its last stage. The victim experiences immensely painful last days just before his or her death. For a voluntary case of mercy killing to take place, the killer must first obtain the consent of the victim, but there have been recorded cases of mercy killing against the wishes of the victim as well.

This is known as involuntary mercy killing. Mercy killing is known as euthanasia. The victim of a mercy killing dies a painless death after suffering an incurable ailment or serious injury. The term euthanasia, which means mercy killing, is derived from the Greek word for 'good death'. Euthanasia has been legalised in some Western countries but is still considered to be an unethical practice in the Third World."
,"Mercy killing should NOT be legal. Not because jesus or god or whatever gave us life, but because we as human being are corrupt, we can never have a legalized say over the existence of another life, even if it is given.  On a whole killing is recognized as wrong, suicide is recognized as wrong, and the making of death to be friendlier, easier, more comfortable is wrong. If there are those in pain, let them be euthanized, but let it be done in secret. Some doctors are willing to do this. But this should not be a well versed option, it then poses too much a threat to be abused."
,"Mercy Killing
Definition:

1. Euthanasia:
An easy or painless death, or the intentional ending of the life of a person suffering from an incurable or painful disease at his or her request. The intentional termination of the life of one human being by another.

OR

The intentional killing by act or omission of a dependent human being for his or her alleged benefit. The key word here is ""intentional"". If death is not intended, it is not an act of euthanasia."
,"Mercy killing is the choice of the individual and it should be universally recognized as such! It is heinous to suggest that because someone else disagrees with the voluntary ending of your life you have to suffer intolerable pain! How would you feel if you were lying in a hospital bed; struggling to breath and in terrible pain from an incurable cancer, wanting only to end it and somebody told you you were only allowed to die if the cancer decided to kill you some time soon? I'd be infuriated and seek to end my own life in some way anyway if I could not end the lives of the cowards who kept me suffering pointlessly because of their weak stomachs. Just because the rest of society has not come to terms with death does not mean that people who are dying of chronic illness or even the effects of life itself should have to suffer from that selfish ignorance."
,I think mercy-killing is not the solution to get rid of patience.because it is a kind of crime.I am a muslim and believe in God.so it is illegal action.not because I am a muslim to say it is illegal.it is not humanity to kill someone who is suffering from pain.if we kill someone so what is humanity or what is your definition of humanity.God give us this opportunity to live in this world and only God decided whether we live or die.life is a gift from God to us.
,"I feel that helping a patient from incurable and painful disease by mercy killing is right.If he is living with pain and problems,atleast he can die peacfully."
,"Mercy killing should definitely NOT be legal. NO human can just decide who has to die, it is the patients wish to die. There might be a chance that the tremendously ill person might be able to get well later, miracles do happen!"
,"What about the person that wants to end thier life and has thought about it for many years but does not want to make a mess of it! Because if they do mess up ie overdose that leaves them blind deaf paraplegic etc and end up being even more of a burden on thier friends and family? Not to mention the cost to the service's (doctors, nurses, surgeons, ambulance paramedics, police etc, when most of these service's could be helping those with awful illnesses that really desperately want hold on to life!  Also how many other people then have to be involved, if you jump over a cliff or stand on train lines or drive head on into a wall or shoot your self in the head or cut your wrists etc etc etc! It involves so so many other service's and its usually a MESS! It goes on every day. Some of these people have thought about this for years and all they really want is a peaceful exit from the sadness. I would like compassionate help and a safe way of your own decision to leave this life if that is what one wants to do."
,Mercy killing is the killing of one who is in pain or suffering of some sort
,"Mercy is the term used when one person kills another to relief the victim from futher suffering. Such as someone who is in cronic incurable pain and pleeds for their own death. The first ones could go back to biblical times,say someone badly injuried in battle would be put out of suffering by a fellow soldier."
,In my view mercy killing is helpful for a person who was suffering with an incurable problem. But it should be a legal. That means with the permission of the victim you should apply this mercy killing.
,Mercy killing should be allowed only when the disease is incurable and after doctors have tried their level best to cure them. Again it should be with the consent of the patient. Involuntary and non-voluntary mercy killing should be strictly prohibited. Only voluntary mercy killing should be legalized but various conditions should be there.
,"It is good, the fellow is going to die, sooner or later. Make thing settle faster, may be good to all. Provided the family member allow it and where the patient totally don't have the ability to think and talk anymore.
But make sure it is not a killing with bad purpose and make Euthanasia as a excuse to kill others."
,Killing a suffering person
,To set a person free from his sufferings and it should be legal.
,The life is a gift from God nobody else is allowed to end this life
,"I think it should be legalised, because everyone  wants to live a peaceful life
it should be better to kill the person who lives stressfull life"
,Killing of one person by another is called mercy killing.It should not be illegal.In my point of view the person who involve in this mercy killing he is the worst person in the world and I think he don't know about humanity.We are the human beings not animals.Born like a human being is a great one.
,"Mercy killing is not right. Whether or not you have the persons consent, isn't suicide a horrible image in your head? Euthanasia is defined as helping someone die. Couldn't that be considered a murder? How would it feel to have to deal with the fact that you assisted in the DEATH of a friend. Someone referenced Of Mice and Men earlier. Wouldn't George feel terrible about the act he committed to his one true friend? He has to live with that for the rest of his life! That could just lead him to end his life in the same way. Mercy killing is NOT the answer."

,Killing a suffering person
,A practice that enables a person to kill another person who is suffering from something and can't help themselves anymore. Whether is right or wrong is own choice. In part is considered to be right because when you can't help yourself to have a normal life or when you are at a hospital knowing that you have a limited life or that you too old that can't even serve yourself you would desire to end it quick. For other people is like just killing itself and shouldnt be allowed. It's a really controversial topic.
,Mercy killing is to kill somebody that is suffering..suffering very bad..they might have injury's very painful and it can't be solve...so what I think about that mercy killing situation is to be illegal in the whole world ..a lot of people suffer just for seeing other people suffering..so the good thing to do to those people or animals is to kill them illegal.doing a mercy killing .where ever they going.... They going to a better place and they wont suffer ..... So mercy killing is a crime??or a illegal crime?
,"This life belongs to me, my parents gave it to me, not jesus or any god. So if I want to end it, noone can stop me even my parents, because they gave it to me already. That´s why I say mercy killing is necessary for terminally ill patients"
,Mercy kiling should be made legal..as its only helpig someone to get rid of the pain which is killing him/her each day or each second. As we know that the victim is asked wether he /she wants to live or not...so itsthe victims decision thats why I don't think so that it is a crime in any manner.

,Easier said than done! Mercy killing is necessary to all those patients who is suffering  from incurable and painful disease.
,Mercy killing is not a correct way. Why because our life is the god gift through our parents we don't have any type of rides to kill another person. Really it is a type of crime!
,Mercy killing is not only that killing a person or a patient. It is just getting the patient rid from the disease and as well as life
,Mercy killing should not be legalise because this can also lead to increase in crime rate in the country especially india
,"It should,nt be legal because mercy killing are same as sucide, and sucide is a very big sin...... Allah does,nt give us a permission for sucide or mercy killing...."
,"Mercy killing as per by-laws to those suffering a terminal illness should be allowed at least relieve him or her from pain. Doctors should be allowed to examine the illness and come up with a consent to carry out the practice.

,"Mercy killing should be legal only when the governemnt makes some strict rules like team of doctors who take the decision  and  they should not be  governemnt... And no one else should take decision in place of the patient .
As written by one of the guest above I don't hti nk mercy killing is a great hting it can be misused one needs to be to be very careful."
,To fell pity for the sufferer...and end it for them even if they can't speak..who wants to be in pain at thier death
,Mercy killing is done for the people who is going to die with lot of sufferings. Its nothing wrong n it should be legal.
,Aaording to me mercy killing shoud not be legalised. If it is legalised there will be more unfair means practice & unwanted things would have practice on its name

How Do I Download Music From Youtube To My Usb.?,"Downloading music from YouTube is very easy if you know what to do. However, if you support the music industry and the artist or band who made the song then it would be much better of you to buy the CD or purchase and download the album from an online store such as iTunes.

However if you wish to download the music directly from YouTube then all you need to do is open up YouTube and search for the song that you want to download. Make sure that you find a version of the song that is clear or high quality, preferably not the music video as a lot of music videos contain scenes or noises that aren't on the official song. Preferably you should choose one that someone else has made which shows the lyrics.

Then what you need to do is to open a separate window and perform a Google search for 'YouTube to mp3'. Open up this page and then go back to YouTube. Copy the address bar that is at the top of the page and then paste it into the YouTube convertor and press convert. Once it has converted download the file directly onto your computer.

Once the download is complete, insert your USB into your computer and then open up the folder. Look in your download page to locate the files that you have just downloaded and then drag and drop them into your USB folder. However if you wish to keep a copy of the music file on your computer then you should just copy and paste them into the USB file.

If you are transferring the files to another computer then all you need to do is insert your USB stick into the computer, open the folder and then copy and paste them across into a file on the computer."

What Is Insurance?,"Hi
Insurance is a promise or an assurance by the insurer to the insured to compensate for specific potential future losses in exchange for periodic payments (premiums). Insurance is designed to protect individuals, entity, firms, etc. Against unexpected financial losses. Some insurance forms are mandatory by law while others though extremely useful like life and health insurance are optional."
,"Insurance: Human life is exposed to many risks, which may result in heavy financial losses. Insurance is one of the devices by which risks may be reduced or eliminated in exchange for premium. In words of Chief Justice Tindal, ""Insurance is a contract in which a sum of money is paid by the assured in consideration of the insurer's incurring the risk of paying larger sum upon a given contingency.

In this legal aspect it is a contract whereby one person agrees to indemnify another against a loss which may happen or to pay a sum of money to him on the occurring of a particular event. All contracts of insurance (except marine insurance) may be verbal or in waiting; but practically contracts of assurance are included in a document.

Some principles of insurance: The following are the basic essentials or requirements of insurance concerned.
1. Utmost good faith. All types of contracts of insurance depends the contracts of utmost good faith. Both parties (insurer and the insured) in the contract must disclose all material facts for the benefit of each other. False information of non-disclosure of any important fact makes the contract avoidable. So the conditions to show utmost good faith are very strict on the part of the insured.

2. Insurable interest. The insured must possess an insurable interest in the object insured. It may be defined as a financial interest in the subject matter of contract. The presence of insurable interest is a legal requirement. So an insurance contract without the existence of insurable interest is not legally valid and cannot be claimed in a Court. The object of this principle is to prevent insurance from becoming a gambling contract."

What Is Insurance?,"Hi
Insurance is a promise or an assurance by the insurer to the insured to compensate for specific potential future losses in exchange for periodic payments (premiums). Insurance is designed to protect individuals, entity, firms, etc. Against unexpected financial losses. Some insurance forms are mandatory by law while others though extremely useful like life and health insurance are optional."
,"Insurance: Human life is exposed to many risks, which may result in heavy financial losses. Insurance is one of the devices by which risks may be reduced or eliminated in exchange for premium. In words of Chief Justice Tindal, ""Insurance is a contract in which a sum of money is paid by the assured in consideration of the insurer's incurring the risk of paying larger sum upon a given contingency.

In this legal aspect it is a contract whereby one person agrees to indemnify another against a loss which may happen or to pay a sum of money to him on the occurring of a particular event. All contracts of insurance (except marine insurance) may be verbal or in waiting; but practically contracts of assurance are included in a document.

Some principles of insurance: The following are the basic essentials or requirements of insurance concerned.
1. Utmost good faith. All types of contracts of insurance depends the contracts of utmost good faith. Both parties (insurer and the insured) in the contract must disclose all material facts for the benefit of each other. False information of non-disclosure of any important fact makes the contract avoidable. So the conditions to show utmost good faith are very strict on the part of the insured.

2. Insurable interest. The insured must possess an insurable interest in the object insured. It may be defined as a financial interest in the subject matter of contract. The presence of insurable interest is a legal requirement. So an insurance contract without the existence of insurable interest is not legally valid and cannot be claimed in a Court. The object of this principle is to prevent insurance from becoming a gambling contract."

Why Do I Always Feel Depressed When Christmas Is Over?,"Like everyone else I get depressed after xmas but then after a couple of weeks the same old routine kicks in and its all forgotten, but this year I can't stop thinking about xmas I have been planning for this years since early jan!! I often just get bored so come on the computer and look at xmas websites, which is how I got here. At first I thought I was being silly and then I wondered if I should talk to someone about it, but then I realised I just love it so much for all the right reasons family, friends, the films, the decorations, the sense that everyone is just that bit happier and more polite, a sense of magic in the air, presents, the food, the magic and sense the world gets a little bit better. Then I remembered what tiny tim said in scrooge about keeping christmas well all year, maybe if we all did we would all just be that bit happier and polite and get back some of that magic lost as a child"
,"After every Xmas night, I lay in my bed and tears come dripping down my face. Every year the same thoughts go through my head, where has the time gone? All my family is getting so old and big. I look back and remember the tears running down my fathers eyes when we gather around the table on Xmas eve. I remember the glassy eyes that appear on my uncles face when my young cousins open their gifts with such joy. I cry thinking about my grandfathers beautiful tears that drip down his face when his granddaughter gives him a five dollar bill for Xmas. These are the things you must love. For some it may be the gifts, but as you get older, you realize that the family is so much more important than the gifts you receive from Santa. Jesus was born in Xmas day. We celebrate him being our savior. When I look back on the past two days on Xmas night, I remember the great joy everybody had and the love that was in the house. I see my divorced uncle s tears in his eyes when he watches his beautiful children open their gifts. Thank you Jesus. Happy birthday."
,It always happens when ever we are with our with our family and friends and celebrate something .We enjoy alt at that time after that time is over we miss that moment and feel so lonely .
,"Our tree is still up...no kidding. It's coming down tomorrow finally. I always get sad when it ends because it's one last Christmas when my kids are 6 and 9. Next year they will be 7 and 10. Christmas is precious when your kids are young so the way I see it, when it ends, then it's one less Christmas for this stage in their lives. This is the first year in years that I don't feel so sad and I think it's because we are so busy, there was some illness during the holidays and because I have many plans for the immediate future. It's flown by."
,"Christmas is a hectic time. There's the stress of choosing and buying presents for friends and family, and it's that time of year when all the family get together, so when January approaches and its time for everyone to go home and get back to work, the house will seem very quiet. You're probably feeling depressed because it's all over and you have to settle in at work again.

Winter also begins around Christmas, so you may be feeling depressed because the weather is miserable. Also, the act of taking down Christmas decorations can make people feel depressed. Perhaps you are feeling depressed because a new year has started and you feel lost because Christmas is over.

On the plus side though, you have the January sales to look forward too! Also, if you've made a new year's resolution and you stick to it, then you will feel better and as though you have achieved something."
,I'm alone and everyone's grown! So I miss them a lot!
,I feel exactly the same but its because all the family are happy and in a festive mood and it wont be the same for another year
,Cause I love every second of christmas morning unwrapping presents and then when its over I realize that went by too fast it wasnt long enough. For me time flies during christmas day and christmas eve and when its over I get all sad. If I hear a christmas song at the beginning of january I break down
,"Maybe because in these days you feel more close to your family or love ones, and when it finished, everyone goes back to a normal life and you still need them to feel OK."
,I think it is due to the excitement and energy of the season finally being over. A person can feel relieved that another holiday has passed but at the same time they may feel saddened that it is actually gone and not to return for another whole year.
,I feel the same way. Like I just thought about Christmas right now and I'm starting to feel depressed. I love that time of year. 6 months away. :[
,"I feel more depressed in the weeks leading up to Christmas. People stressing over buying the perfect gift. Stores with Santa and reindeer pictures blaring songs about mommy kissing Santa Claus, while they try to convince you to spend money. The general idea that Christmas and happiness lie in getting gifts, and the general madness that have become modern corperate 'Christmas'. What is forgotten is peace. Peace brought through a small child, said to be born of a virgin. Peace brought through a small child, who many believed fulfilled promises made by God to His people. Peace brought through a small child, who after living a phenomenal life, was crucified, died, and was entombed... Yet who many believe rose again from the dead so that we might all have true peace with the God who made us. I feel depressed because people often miss the hope that this season reminds us of."
,Because you love christmas. It is a time of good cheer when everyone is so happy and festive. And of course there are all the wonderful traditions that only happen at christmas time. After it is all over you have to wait a whole year for it to happen again.
,"It's like one of Newton's laws that for every action there is an equal, opposite reaction. After all the excitement, fussing, and fun, it all comes to an abrupt end. What goes up must come down so to speak. But now you get to play with all the new toys you got for Christmas. Cheer up!"
,You feel that way because you don't get any more presents
,I don't know. I feel more re leaved.
,Christmas is when you have fun with all of your relatives and drink lots of eggnog. You might be hung-over or you might be home sick or even the you might be feeling down is because you never got that present that you REALLY wanted.
,"Short & Simple: Family & Friends go back to their homes ,thus leaving you to do all the cleaning after your X-MAS party!"
,"Well, if you're a kid, it means back to school. If you're an adult, it probably means back to work. With a hangover=)"
,Because leading up to christmas is always the exciting bit but when christmas is here it seems to be like its just over
,"READ THIS AND DON'T LET CHRISTMAS END--IT'LL END
ANY DEPRESSION YOU FEEL NOW!!!because you're like me..you like the cheeriness of and closeness of being with your family and friends at a time that bonds everyone ..the shopping for loved ones is so cool..wasn't it a head rush to look for stuff to buy for mom and dad and friends? Walking around the store knowing what they would wouldn't(probably) like to recieve on christmas day? It's  a very emotionally happy sensation that lingers in your head for two months before christmas,thinking about the possible gifts that family and friends would wind up buying for you and then there's the decorating of the tree and the lights that need to be put on the windows or on the balcony and not to mention the cheeriness of the christmas conversations that go on  all november and december..talking about gifts,conversing about the right place for the tree, and I can't even begin to explain why you'd miss christmas after it's over..I only covered a tiny tiny bit of it all.it doesn't have to end.I 've decide to buy my parents inexpensive stuff a couple times a week at the dollar stores here in town..also the thrift stores..I'm talking about inexpensive ,not expensive..dollar stuff..(maybe 2 or 3 dollars)..a scented candle  here and there,a coffee mug from the 99 cents only store,etc..buying  stuff like that for parents or friends or for who'mevr you choose,a couple times a week or more.. Can literally keep enough of that christmas spirit alive that you won't miss christmas all year long..the really neat part of it..wrap the items you buy in wrapping paper ,just as though it's still christmas...either hand the gifts directly to who'mever your giving them to or  secretly leave them in a place in  their house where they'll be sure to find them after you leave..don't let christmas end.keep it alive  all year into the  christmas season of 2010, in an inexpensive but postive way!! I am!!

Good luck!!!!"
,As you have to wait until November until the build up starts again.
,"Because when Christmas is over you don't get any more cool stuff, if you even got the cool stuff that you wanted. You have to go back to work, and work all year long just to pay for all the cool stuff you bought for everyone, only to do it all over again."
,In the last week I've been feeling really depressed but perhaps as soon as we are more into january I will start to feel better.
,"You are sad cause the excitement is Over for this year as your kids/family leaves. I am just the opposite. I have a small family...only men are living and then there is my daughter and me. Quite frankly, our life is extremely busy and we are finally off for 2 or 3 days and we want to be ALONE. We do not want to be disturbed by their needs and wanting somewhere to eat. If they are invited, we grill blackened filet mignon and they gripe cause it is NOT Turkey. Well, even if I had all day, I will not cook a meal for 4 hours and within 20 mins, it is eaten. I am just happier alone or with the neighbors AFTER their kids have left.Now, once my daughter is married, I realize my attitude may have to change. But then I will be willing to fly, help and converse with in-laws. But I will be retired by then and will WANT to do it. Wanting makes all of the difference!! Lol"

Do I Pay Tax On My Ira Withdrawal After Age 60?,"The answer to the question of whether or not you have to pay tax on an IRA (Individual Retirement Account) withdrawal once you’re over the age of 60 partly rests on what kind of IRA you have, a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. Only a Roth IRA offers the option of a tax-free withdrawal, an age over 60 being one of the requirements.

A traditional IRA has strict eligibility requirements, and every withdrawal from a traditional IRA is subject to federal income tax. The traditional IRA contrasts with the Roth IRA, which offers what are called qualified withdrawals.

As long as you’ve had your Roth IRA for at least five years, which is the other requirement for a qualified withdrawal, you do not have to pay tax on a withdrawal from it once you’re over the age of 60. This is one of the main advantages that a Roth IRA has over a traditional IRA.

Another difference between a traditional IRA and a Roth IRA is that contributions to a traditional IRA can be tax deductible, whereas contributions to a Roth IRA can never be tax deductible.

If you’re not over 60, or if you have not had the IRA for at least five years, the amount of tax paid on a withdrawal from either a Roth IRA (as well as a traditional IRA) can be as high as 20 percent.

If you’re looking for withdrawals that are not subject to federal income tax, then you want a Roth IRA. Just know that you can’t deduct any contributions to a Roth IRA from your income tax."
,I have a guarenteed amount on my annuities but I can take 8207.00 next month when I turn 59.5  What or how much tax will I have to pay I' am retired and applying for permanent disability
,"Depends on what type IRA. (Traditional or Roth)
 
For traditional, I believe the financial institution holds about 20% for taxes.
 
I am not an expert on this, obviously.
 
If you google ""taxes on IRAs"", you will get a lot of sites to review on the issue."
,"If I withdraw money from my Regular IRA rollover in a Roth IRA, how do you calculate the taxes on the amount withdraw"
,"I've just made a lump sum withdrawal from my IRA.  It's considered to be a distribution.  Please see www.irs.gov .  Look up ""Forms and Publications"".  Find the instructions for the 2007 Form 1040, got to pages 21 ans 22.  If you made non-deductible contributions to your IRA over the years, it's possible there could be no tax on the withdrawal.  You should have a copy of your last Form 8606 (Non-Taxable IRA Contributions) which will show your total basis of non-taxable contributions over the years.  With that you will be able to compute what part of the $10,000, if any, will be taxable. "
,"Yes, you’ll have to pay income taxes on a portion or all of the IRA withdrawals you make anytime after age 59½. Hence, if you need money for unplanned expenses, you are suggested to consider all available options before withdrawing from a tax-advantaged IRA, so that your savings can continue to grow. If you are willing to know more about annuity insurance policies, you can visit our site optinsure for the same."

Which online game has the most players?,"It's really hard to judge which games have the most players, Microsoft and Sony don't seem to fond of sharing stats, but PC sites like Steam give a pretty comprehensive list showing the number of servers and players.

Should i change earrings?,"Got both my ears pierced August 6th, so almost two months ago. Recently I was playing basketball and one of them fell out and I lost it. The next day I went to a piercing shop and she said the hole was closed a little so she poked it again with a needle which was quick and painless and put in 2 surgical steel earrings (I had them pierced at claires in august so they were stainless steel before) but she told me the ones she put in are the ones I should have gotten pierced with but they are REALLY.. Anyway my brother got me 14g earrings and I wanted to know if it was safe to put them in due to the fact she had to poke a hole in my other ear does that mean the whole process restarts and I have to wait 6-8 weeks again for the right ear?"
,"If person didn't break the skin when putting in the new one I would wait 2 weeks to wear your new earrings from your brother. If the skin broke, and there was blood I would wait the 6 weeks."

How Do You Remove Dog Urine Stains From Hardwood Floors?,"Pet urine stains are a big pain, especially when you have hard wood floors. Here are some tips on the removal of such stains:

Take some undiluted Hydrogen Peroxide and pour it into a squirt bottle. Spray the stain with this solution and let it remain untouched for around one minute. You should then be able to scrape off the varnish with no difficulty. After doing this, reapply the solution in a generous amount on the area. Let it remain untouched, this time for a longer period of at least two hours. You might have to sand the area and apply hydrogen peroxide many more times, depending on how long back the stain was created and how much surface area it covers. After the stain is off you will have to obviously have to refinish the affected area."
How To Take Care of Oak Furniture?,"To maintain your furniture's shine and repel water, treat the wood with furniture oil, wax, or polish. Moisturize at least once a month to prevent cracking or more frequently (like once a week) if the furniture gets daily wear and tear. You may also want to oil a new or used piece of oak furniture that appears dry.

"Color Ideas For A Small Kitchen With Oak Cabinets,wood Floor And Stainsteel Appliances?",A dark red would look very nice I think
,"I have only one piece of advice, and that's the stick to a maximum of ONE theme, not colour in addition to the wood and glass. Your storage units might start to look very messy if the colours are all over the place. But a yellow-red or a rainbow or a gradient might still work as long as the rest of the room isn't as outstanding!"
,"It is important to plan out first the style you want for your house. It is not just the floorplan that is quite hard to come up with the decision, but the walls too. It needs to be well-matched with not just the flooring but with the cabinets, countertops and other furniture - may it be in the kitchen or other rooms. I would personally suggest to paint your kitchen with Amber toned cabinets in combination with blue gray walls that can beautifully create a contrast with stainless kitchen appliances. It will give a fresh, somewhat classy and modern look. But it still depends in the style you want to achieve. :)

Do you know any people that put celebrities and all the worldly things before God?,"I know of many people who don’t believe in any gods, so by default, they put everything else in front of what they don’t believe."
,"Sure, but lets be specific . . Which God are you referring to?
I also know people who put all worldly things before Santa, The Easter Bunny, and ""Zorg"" the magical Space Pixie . . .
The ""Worldly things"" you refer to are tangible objects we can interact with . . . Like cell phones, Televisions, Cars . . . They require no ""Faith"" to interact or believe in.
To me, it seems much more odd to believe in unverifiable magic claims, then it does to have actual KNOWLEDGE about the material things we interact with  . . . Daily."

,"Q ""Do you know any people that put celebrities and all the worldly things before God?""

Is it just me or do some stores like Walmart in different states have movies that aren't in your local area?,It don't even have to be a different state. I LOVE shopping in other towns just to see what they have! ??
,Probably---they need to cater to the needs and preferences of their local customers.

Do you have a favorite Christmas song? Mine is the Little Drummer Boy. I never get tired of hearing it.,"I do actually, however it wasn't always my favorite. I recall hearing it over and over and over on our way speeding to the hospital Christmas day. It echoed in my brain all night long. And when she dying the next morning I remember falling to my knees and when she died I remember hearing the angels voice! This song haunted me for years after she died. I couldn't handle any Christmas songs actually. I was so bitter, hurt and angry. Until He moved that mountain for me Christmas of 2013 and the pain eased up clearing away the clouds that formed over my heart and soul. But the song still echoed. Until two Christmas's ago when I realized the song or the season had nothing to do with her for I had always had her on the throne and once I took her off of the throne and put Him on the throne I realized that song was no longer a sad song about her rather it was a happy song about Him. Now when I hear it, it's a reminder of where I was and a reassurance of where I am now. It is like a scar. It no longer hurts but the remembrance is still there. It is a happy song I can not get enough of.... Lee Greenwood's ""Oh Holy Night."""

Solution #2 - Everything Else (packages from Expedia, Travelocity, Orbitz, Bookit, Voyages Aqua Terra, etc)
It never hurts to check both worlds, just be sure you're comparing apples to apples, in terms of what you're getting.

Does a lip piercing hurt? Im 14 years old and i cant stand needles... How do u all think i will take the pain?,All piercing hurts. Why would you want to disfigure your pretty face? Aren't happy with what you have?
,Yes it hurts!
,Of course it hurts! Something is going in that was never intended to go in! Rethink your piercing fantasies!
,"Pain is one of the ways that your body suggests that you stop doing what you are doing.
Death is the body's way of saying you were in the wrong line of work.
Listen to your body while you can still hear it speaking."
,i would assume that it does.
,Have you ever bitten your lip? Nothing went through your skin and muscle and yet it still hurt. So yes a lip piercing hurts. Know what else hurts? An infected lip piercing. A wound in your mouth can trap food and bacteria that can cause an infection. To avoid yhat you have yo keep it extra clean. That means moving snd tugging on that wound. More pain.  So good luck with that.
,"It's VERY painful, but then once you have it . . You have a metal needle of some sort always in there, just waiting for you to bump or smash you mouth into so it can either tear through the lip or rip the gums from the other side . . . Think PASSED the ""look"" for a moment about what this means to you going forward . . ."

,Perversion
,"The negative aspect of Facebook is that people cannot concentrate on a task anymore these days..  Everyone I know that works for a corporation is more on Facebook than doing the job they get paid for.
Meanwhile, they are on messenger complaining how boring their work is.. Then they come home and are more on messenger.. (for me this is a paradox)
Nobody these days can do deep work anymore bcs they are whole the time distracted by others. If I want to concentrate I get annoyed by people who work in a corporation and have nothing to do while working but just talking to me on messenger.. We just waste each others time and achieve nothing in life.. And when you look back how you spend your life you feel empty and not satisfied because you have achieved nothing only talked  on messenger and complaining how boring life is.."

,Social media has not completly the really negative effect but positive also. I am addict to facebook. Few day ago I was browsing for corporate website development company over google I came across a website Webdecorum. This is amazing website designing company from india
,"Highly time consumingOne big misconception people have about social media is that: It’s FREE.
There are several free or low-cost tools are available, but you have to
deploy a substantial about of your time to understand and learn the

social media activities on their marketing strategies successfully
understand how much time it takes to learn and implement all of them."

What Is The Dialling Code For Canada From The UK?,"The dialling code for Canada when calling from the UK is 00 1 followed by the area code of the city you are calling then the telephone number of the house you are calling. You can find a list of area codes for Canada and other countries at www.countrycodes.com/
Whenever you are calling another country outside of the UK the international prefix is always 00. This is then followed by the code assigned to that country; in this case the dialling code for Canada is 1.

If you are calling Canada from a mobile phone in the UK, then the 00 is replaced with a + symbol. So it will be +1 then the city dialling code followed by the phone number. If you have a Smartphone the + symbol should be obvious on your keypad, possibly above the O. If not and it is not immediately obvious where it is then you may need to try pressing and holding 0 or the * to get the + symbol.

If you go to the Country Codes website mentioned above you can get a $5 free prepaid phone card and really good savings on international calls. To call Canada from the UK using a prepaid phone card you will need to dial the access number on the card and then when prompted enter your PIN number. Then all you need to do is follow the instructions above for calling an Canada from the UK using the dialling code 00 1."

Did Thomas Malthus suggest euthanasia as a method of dealing with population growth?,"Dear Goaty McSheepson,
No; I doubt that Malthus (1766-1834), a clergyman, would ever have suggested euthanasia. He saw population as limited by war, disease, and famine; and his suggestion for an alternative to that, was a form of moral restraint. Although he viewed birth control as sinful, he thought people could marry later in life, which would lead to fewer children.
He is known primarily as the first economist to propose a systematic theory of population; that population growth happens exponentially, while food supply increases arithmetically. However his work did not include the effects of the Industrial Revolution and many other recent factors.
http://www.s-cool.co.uk/a-level/geography/population/revise-it/population-models
http://cgge.aag.org/PopulationandNaturalResources1e/CF_PopNatRes_Jan10/CF_PopNatRes_Jan108.html"
,"I don't think so. I think he was the guy who suggested that human population growth was limited by the ability to grow food. (Not really THAT clever if you think about it). At some time in the future the amount of food that can be produced will plateau. At that point, so will the human population of the world (if humanity has not put an end to itself in other ways long before that)."
,"Just a different shine of the light:
It is ""....easy to lose sight of Malthus’s actual conclusion: That because humans have not all starved, economic choices must be at work, and it is the job of an economist to study those choices.""

why chemistry is a SERVANT OF SCIENCE?,"Chemistry is a fascinating science, full of unusual trivia! Here are some of the interesting fact related to Chemistry.
Chemistry in our body
When someone mentions Chemistry, we generally think of the complex equations and label it boring. Maybe it is the way the subject is taught in schools that make it uninteresting. But did you know thatall of us come across chemistry in everyday life? You’d be surprised to know that Chemistry is everywhere in the world around you! It’s in the food you eat, clothes you wear, water you drink, medicines, air… you name it.
The above thing is given by the reference of the article
https://www.zigya.com/blog/chemistry-in-everyday-life/
According to me a servant of the chemistry is Organic chemistry.  All the is made of carbon and it play vital role in human, nature and all the surrounding things."
What Is The Effects Of Euthanasia?,The persons family may also affected due to it.
,"Euthanasia can have the following disadvantages
Lack/ poor Human dignity
Pain and regrets to the family of the patients
Can lead to unnecessary deaths if not well governed by the law.
Cost reduction in some cases
The pain one may go through is reduced."
,"The effects of euthanasia would include: Human rights violation, indignity,, and many more."
Euthanasia: Should We Allow It?,"If a person is in their death bed and will be in much pain. It should be the family's right to ask for it or decide it. Cancer can be very painful and a long long death and sometimes a very quick death. If a person is in right mind and decides it is the best way, then yes. But not all in the family will agree to it. Even if its the best. Some thinks that during a short time there may be a cure. But not likely."
,"I don't believe that it's right to make a
person live a life that is unbearable to
them (or to a family if the patient 'isn't there')
just to make other people feel better.
Everybody gets on their little soap box
and shouts out about the RIGHT TO LIVE.
When are they going to do it for the
RIGHT TO DIE?  I do believe that a doctor
ought to be on hand for it and not be a 'do it
yourself' sort of deal.  I don't believe that such
forms of release should be called murder or suicide.
Letting a loved one go is hard to do, but seeing one
laying there, the same color as the sheets and
wasting away, dying by inches, should be harder.
Keeping them alive is a comfort to you, not any sort
of kindness to them.   At that point, dying is a gift.
A loving heart should give it."
,"Well, tell you the truth it's very illegal to use.

It does have a set back it sometimes don't work."
,"Actually, to some extent, it is being done today in every hospital in the U.S.  Feeding tubes are being removed, respirators are turned off, ""extra"" morphine is administered to counter pain until it affects the patients ability to continue living.  It is always done with the consent of the family and the doctor must agree, but it is done.  They simply do not call it euthanasia.  It was just done to a good friend of mine about 2 weeks ago.  He had a stroke and was not able to speak, move, or breathe on his own.  He could not eat etc.  They removed his breathing apparatus & increased the morphine, and he died in a matter of a very few hours after 9 days of medical life.  He and his wife had discussed this procedure long before his stroke.  This is a question each of us needs to discuss with family members.  Just how much support do you want from your medical staff and for how long??"
,"No,but a show I just watched showed there is not much we can do about it unless we start policing the internet first. There is a group of people that have their own business helping people die . They go to other countries that basically allow it to happen instead of fighting it in court.helping put a stop to these group of people doing it."
,"Yes. If the person asks for it themselves, It is legal
If a baby is born without limbs or perhaps is born in a permanent coma, the mother should have the right to order a mercy killing, or in the same case if the child is severely and permanently injured or is retarded or has syndrome. But people could start abusing the right for euthanasia and soon people might ""mercy"" kill their children if they have ADD or ADHD, or something else not as major.
My final statement would be yes, sometimes living itself is a debt to yourself and its own poison and punishment, far worse than can be described in my short answer for this extremely complicated subject. Those who would disagree can not understand or have not witnessed what pain can really be."
,"If They Have A Painful.. Agonizing Constant Pain. Of Cancer And Tons Of Pain Meds Are Not Helping  Yes For Sure.. Close Relatives Should Decide On This...

,Yes. It should be allowed.
,I am going to say No on the grounds that Keithold has already stated.
,Do you mean for peoples or animals? Either one should be allowed.
,"G'day Omnom,

Thank you for your question.

On balance, probably not as there is the temptation to play God. If it is introduced, there should be a number of protections in place.

,"No, every human being should compensate the life in any situation.It's the God rule.
If you don't believe the god ,then also don't believe the pain.What would you get by killing a person on that reason.Do you remove his pain.No, you are not removing pain but you are taking away the life."
,"Well, we surely should NOT allow the government to ALLOW and PASS euthanasia. In Fact the government should KEEP it's nose OUT. If a person has a will stating that the person should be allowed to die that is another case. I believe that all people have the CHOICE as to whether they prefer to lay up there and suffer or not. This is a person's choice and we should not allow the government to play God."
,Not a chance!^_^
,"Euthanasia should be allowed or not is a negotiable point that can be argued equally on both sides.
Argument defending Euthanasia
Some communities and religion such as Hindus believe under good guidance its morally right to ease the agony of the patient if no signs of recovery. As a was express freedom of choice one is left with that right to make his own choices. Some sickness is too expensive to sustain a patient for some period especially to life support machines but finally, the patient dies. These costs can be reduced through Euthanasia with precise consent. Pain and agony is another point that the patient can face and at times doctors are left with no other option but to listen to the urge to reduce the suffering through Euthanasia
  Arguments Against.
People may take advantages of this practices and cause unnecessary deaths. While other religions believe its morally upright others feels that God is the one who should decide when your life should to an end. If over done can reduce the sense of humanity. Those involved in the practices especialy the relatives of the patients may face a life time regret of there action."
,"Yea sure, I'd want the option if and when I find myself in a situation that brought me no chance of hope and a ton of pain."
What Are The Pros And Cons Of Euthanasia?,"Pro's:
-People with incurable diseases, where treatment wouldn’t affect their quality of life, should have a choice
-Why should you have to live and suffer?
-When people say it is Gods choice, I don’t think God would want you to suffer
-When people are denied Euthanasia, a lot of them end up committing suicide, so euthanasia is a more humane way to die
-Humans should be treated just as well as animals are medically
-There would be no financial burden (medical bills)
-People argue that legalizing euthanasia (assisted suicide) is a way to ensure that no one will die in agony or unremitting suffering"
,"Euthanasia, as defined, is always a practice under consent either with the client or the relatives.
Pros.
Saves a lot of expenses.
Relieves pain to the patient
Expresses some freedom of decision making.
To some community like Hindus it's morally right and 
Cons
Perceived as an ethical in some religions
No value for human life
If not well regulated by laws  can lead to unnecessary killings in the name of Euthanasia
Can bring regrets in life especially to those who are directly involved."

euthanasia pros and cons"
What Is Euthanasia?,"Euthanasia is derived from the Greek words Euthan (good) and thanatos (death). It refers to the voluntary termination of the life of a person or animal in a painless manner.

Dr. Jack Kevorkian is the name that is cited the most when euthanasia is discussed. He claims to have assisted more than 125 terminally ill patients to die peacefully. Pro-choice activists have always argued that when a person is terminally ill and is in a lot of pain he should be allowed the liberty to choose between life and death. Dr. Kevorkian and his ilk offer a painless death, usually via a drug overdose or withdrawal of life support. There have been documented cases of doctors writing 'do not resuscitate' in their notes in cases concerning terminally ill patients. It is unclear if this can be considered euthanasia.

Euthanasia can be also be non-voluntary when the patient lacks decision-making capacity and their proxies are not informed that the patient is going to be euthanized."
,"Essentially it is mercy killing. When a person (or an animal for that matter) is so ill that their life has no quality, and there is no real hope that they will get better, some people believe that is kinder to help that being to die peacefully rather than continue suffering.

It is done routinely for pets when their condition cannot be treated, but the case for the same thing being available for humans is still a passionately debated issue."

How Do You Determine The Type Of Wood The Furniture Is Made Of?,"It is quite hard tricky to determine the type of wood a furniture is made of. But here are some of the basic ways to know and help you in identifying wood.

1. It is necessary to be certain that furniture is actually a solid wood or if it is a man-made composite that is created to imitate wood.
2. You have to look for the growth rings. This is what determines the age of a tree as it is formed by the tree's yearly growth. If you see an end-grain it is a proof that your furniture is indeed made of genuine wood.
3. Another feature to look out for is the venneer or a repeating grain pattern.
4. Next one is the grain color. However, some wood when exposed mostly by outside elements can turn into a darker shade or even lose color due to age.
5. Texture also gives away the type of wood. If it is perfectly smooth and has no grain indentation, it might probably one f the softwoods. But if it has an open pore structure it is most likely to be hardwoods such as oak, maple or mahogany. It is has a curly grain it can be birch or cherry.
6. You also must consider the hardness, thickness and weight of the wood. Since these features can help you in comparing the density of wood and examine the overall characteristic of it.
Hope this helps.

What Is Best Way To Prepare Wood Base Floor Before Installing Ceramic Tile?,"You will want to get a backer board designed for your application. Note that while you have removed the hardwood floor and plywood base you may want to calculate the total thickness of the material removed, or the thickness needed to bring the finished tile surface level with the adjoining floor. I am restoring a 100 year old home and have undertaken the same task. In one room I only removed the finished floor and left the subfloor. Mine was 3/4"" thick so I opted for a backer board that was 1/2"" thick. With my thinset motar and tile thickness, my finished floor levels for new and existing will be the same.
Be sure to follow manufacturer's installation instructions for your backerboard.

What Is The Risk Of Termite Damage In Engineered Wood Flooring In Miami Fl?,Unfortunately I just found out the hard way. I've had my engineered Brazilian Cherry wood floor down less than 1 year after noticing some cupping in certain areas. I just removed a section today and discovered a termite infestation. The termites were attracted to the wood and ate through the floor pad to get at it. These are subterranean termites that got in through cracks in the foundation that I though I had sealed up. The wood buckled due to moisture from the termites mud tubes and being eaten by the termites. I'm now forced to remove all the wood and have the foundation treated for termites and the slab sealed before putting the wood back down. I live in the Orlando Fl area where apparently the risk of termite damage is high.

How Do People Get Possessed By The Devil? Do You Know Someone Who Has Been Possessed Before? What Things Did They Do That They Had No Control Over?,"Each person will react differently to demonic possession, but you only need to look as far as the Bible for what possession by a demon is like.

If you need help figuring out whether someone has been possessed, here are the symptoms to look out for:

What happens to someone who is possessed by the Devil

Although many people might not believe in Satanic possessions, the truth is this phenomenon is actually mentioned in the Bible.

According to the Bible, there are several signs and symptoms of possession:

The demon's personality takes over the host's- All signs of a person's personality will slowly disappear, and be replaced by the demonic personality of the spirit within:
Suddenly they shouted, ""What have you to do with us, Son of God? Have you come here to torment us before the time?"" (Matthew 8:29).

Loss of control- A person who is possessed loses all control of bodily movement and functions:
And when the demon was cast out, the mute man spoke: And the multitudes marveled, saying, It was never so seen in Israel (Matthew 9:33) A possessed person will begin speaking in a different voice- the victim may also use tongues or languages they didn't previously know. Very commonly, ancient languages like Aramaic are used.
Unusual abilities- A person who is possessed might suddenly develop super-human strength and the ability to physically do things that other humans can't. Their knowledge and wisdom (especially of history) might also increase.
So these are the signs to look out for, according to the Bible, but if you genuinely fear that you (or someone you know) has been possessed, then I recommend you get yourself to a priest as soon as possible!"
,"Demons are very real. I didn't used to believe until it happened to me.

Satan will do all he can to weaken a person, making them easier to take over.

Prayer and belief in Christ is the only thing that helps."
,"Trust us you don't want this.
It has been like this for 25 years, no one can help, no one understands.
You do NOT want this."
,"There is nothing glamorous about being possessed by the Devil. I know because I have been and am still dealing with the repercussions of this. I didn't make this choice it was made for me based on a life or death situation.

I think you should be careful in what you say or do because by the intention of putting forth such a request you are putting yourself in an environment that will make you exposed to anything or anyone- and this is definitely not what you want because it will attract things that you do not want in your life and eventually it will destroy your life as well as those people or things around you that you care about.

Shows like the ""Haunting"" seem to want to make it seem as though a possession is something you can try out like a new type of cuisine or something and if you don't like it you can just remove yourself from it or um, not try it again?(Ha Ha, right)

It doesn't work like this AT ALL.
Once you put yourself into this world that's it, there is no walking away or turning back. It can subside somewhat by spending much time and effort, and quite often money to exorcise it or send it away but it is and never will be an easy task.

You literally pay for this with your life and you will be imprisoned as long as you live and you will die as a result of this."
,"Spiritual possession is what occurs when a demon, spirit, animal, or any other disincarnate entity starts to control a body that is not its own.

While the signs of possession are varied some of the changes include changes in personality; in sleep patterns; in weight (that is either loss or gain); and personal hygiene.

Possessed people may start to curse excessively which is typically out of character. Another typical sign to look out for is a sudden aversion to religious items. Such people may take up self- mutilation and become violent.

They may seem to take on a different personality or suffer from multiple personality disorder. Possessed people may seemingly suffer from blackouts in their memory.

They often collect occult materials and become sexually pre-occupied.

According to the Catholic Church, true signs of possession would include a display of superhuman strength, frequently accompanied by fits and convulsions; personality changes; possession of knowledge of the possibly the future or other private information."

,If you spew green stuff!
,the enemy will get the best of you but you have to fight him.
,"To start there is no such thing as devil, it is the people with devilish behaviour. Possessing? Yes, people tend to take advantage of others because of their circumstances."
,"A quick way to find out is, are you able to say this? ""Jesus is My Lord and Savior"" if you can't say it even when you try - there is a possession."
,"I've been possesed 3 times already & I'm only 13!
The ghost that possessed me was verbally violent & people would say that I was cussing. But I couldn't remember cussing."
,"Things come out of your mouth that you don't want to say, and you do things that you have no control over- this sort of thing happens after too much gin and tonic, in my experience.

No need to invoke the devil and his tricky demands for your eternal soul."
,"I think maybe you are just a little sensitive or full of a little nervous emotions. I don't think there are really devils or ghosts, or anything else. The only thing we may sometimes think mysterious is just our spirit.

So my friend, don' t trust anything like that. Trust yourself!"
,"Why would you want to see how it feels to be possessed? Possession is real, the spiritual world is real, and many people take it so lightly.

The only purpose that satan has for us is to destroy us, and to influence us to destroy ourselves. This is no joke, hell is not a fairytale- please be careful what you wish for, my recommendation for you would be Bible study."
,"Possession is not a game. It is easy to become possessed but extremely difficult to get rid of that spirit. I am speaking from experience so don't even go there.

I would suggest you get possessed by the Holy spirit. You will never be the same. You will speak things you don't understand and do things you don't understand and dance and feel like there's no reason gravity should have any control over you.

It's so much more awesome than evil spirits. Try that dude. Either which way your soul goes to whoever possesses it. Think about that too."
,"Since the idea of possession is anti-scientific and goes against all that humans have learned about how psychiatric disorders work, the best answer perhaps it to say that you can just assume that you are not possessed. In the past people with metal illness were said to be 'possessed'. Our culture has thankfully moved beyond those times.
Science and medicine have shown us that events and diseases have natural sources, not supernatural."
,"Wwjd4iana, according to you, most of the world is possessed then, because why on earth would anyone who is not a Christian say that? Such a declaration of faith would be compromising their own beliefs."
,You have to be easy to manipulate. You are not. You are thinking too much.
,"Turn to JESUS, He is the only one that can SAVE you & His name is the only name that can cast out the demons in your life!! I will pray for you!!! God bless!"
,"What happens if you want it to happen, I have read the Bible and I have gone to church a bit actually and to me it's all because I believe that the devil is more real and more alive then God himself

Look at the world and what's happening to those people who didn't deserve (and children) or didn't ask to die but yet your GOD is so easily ready to decide who lives and who dies. There is no right or wrong, it's called CHOICE.

So those of you who read the Bible and believe in GOD good for you but you know what your kid/s could be walking home from school and get hit by a car who is the first person you blame after the driver- GOD

So leave the preaching to those who go to church..I believe in the devil and everything that goes with it, it might be bad but at least you know you're going to die, not live a lie believing in something that is going to kill us all and hide behind a cross."
,"You don't want to be possessed its like someone doing their bidding while you get the bad end of the deal( mostly death). You won't feel anything because you will black out and won't remember.

I haven't been possessed before or anybody else but I bet it won't be a fun ride."
,"Devils are real. We Catholics believe that. Even in other religion there is evidence that there were and are devils.

Yes, they are right - being possessed is not a joke. It will make your life miserable and may cause your death.

To those who don't believe that there are devils even if you're not a Catholic just read the Bible."
,"I believe the devil is in all of us, but sometimes the devil wants some of us
to have a higher percentage of evil. I don't think just anyone can be possessed,
only those worth possessing and corrupting.

I, for example am evil at heart. I feel like the only thing stopping me from doing terrible things is the law. Because of this demons will ignore me, knowing that sooner or later I will show how evil I can be.

You want to be possessed, and from that I can deduce that you are on the evil side of the spectrum, and are less likely to be possessed. So I guess you're shit outta luck, pal"

How Do People Get Possessed By The Devil? Do You Know Someone Who Has Been Possessed Before? What Things Did They Do That They Had No Control Over?,"Each person will react differently to demonic possession, but you only need to look as far as the Bible for what possession by a demon is like.

If you need help figuring out whether someone has been possessed, here are the symptoms to look out for:

What happens to someone who is possessed by the Devil

Although many people might not believe in Satanic possessions, the truth is this phenomenon is actually mentioned in the Bible.

According to the Bible, there are several signs and symptoms of possession:

The demon's personality takes over the host's- All signs of a person's personality will slowly disappear, and be replaced by the demonic personality of the spirit within:
Suddenly they shouted, ""What have you to do with us, Son of God? Have you come here to torment us before the time?"" (Matthew 8:29).

Loss of control- A person who is possessed loses all control of bodily movement and functions:
And when the demon was cast out, the mute man spoke: And the multitudes marveled, saying, It was never so seen in Israel (Matthew 9:33) A possessed person will begin speaking in a different voice- the victim may also use tongues or languages they didn't previously know. Very commonly, ancient languages like Aramaic are used.
Unusual abilities- A person who is possessed might suddenly develop super-human strength and the ability to physically do things that other humans can't. Their knowledge and wisdom (especially of history) might also increase.
So these are the signs to look out for, according to the Bible, but if you genuinely fear that you (or someone you know) has been possessed, then I recommend you get yourself to a priest as soon as possible!"
,"Demons are very real. I didn't used to believe until it happened to me.

Satan will do all he can to weaken a person, making them easier to take over.

Prayer and belief in Christ is the only thing that helps."
,"Trust us you don't want this.
It has been like this for 25 years, no one can help, no one understands.
You do NOT want this."
,"There is nothing glamorous about being possessed by the Devil. I know because I have been and am still dealing with the repercussions of this. I didn't make this choice it was made for me based on a life or death situation.

I think you should be careful in what you say or do because by the intention of putting forth such a request you are putting yourself in an environment that will make you exposed to anything or anyone- and this is definitely not what you want because it will attract things that you do not want in your life and eventually it will destroy your life as well as those people or things around you that you care about.

Shows like the ""Haunting"" seem to want to make it seem as though a possession is something you can try out like a new type of cuisine or something and if you don't like it you can just remove yourself from it or um, not try it again?(Ha Ha, right)

It doesn't work like this AT ALL.
Once you put yourself into this world that's it, there is no walking away or turning back. It can subside somewhat by spending much time and effort, and quite often money to exorcise it or send it away but it is and never will be an easy task.

You literally pay for this with your life and you will be imprisoned as long as you live and you will die as a result of this."
,"Spiritual possession is what occurs when a demon, spirit, animal, or any other disincarnate entity starts to control a body that is not its own.

While the signs of possession are varied some of the changes include changes in personality; in sleep patterns; in weight (that is either loss or gain); and personal hygiene.

Possessed people may start to curse excessively which is typically out of character. Another typical sign to look out for is a sudden aversion to religious items. Such people may take up self- mutilation and become violent.

They may seem to take on a different personality or suffer from multiple personality disorder. Possessed people may seemingly suffer from blackouts in their memory.

They often collect occult materials and become sexually pre-occupied.

According to the Catholic Church, true signs of possession would include a display of superhuman strength, frequently accompanied by fits and convulsions; personality changes; possession of knowledge of the possibly the future or other private information."
,I bet he can't!
,If you spew green stuff!
,the enemy will get the best of you but you have to fight him.
,"To start there is no such thing as devil, it is the people with devilish behaviour. Possessing? Yes, people tend to take advantage of others because of their circumstances."
,"A quick way to find out is, are you able to say this? ""Jesus is My Lord and Savior"" if you can't say it even when you try - there is a possession."
,"I've been possesed 3 times already & I'm only 13!
The ghost that possessed me was verbally violent & people would say that I was cussing. But I couldn't remember cussing."
,"Things come out of your mouth that you don't want to say, and you do things that you have no control over- this sort of thing happens after too much gin and tonic, in my experience.

No need to invoke the devil and his tricky demands for your eternal soul."
,"I think maybe you are just a little sensitive or full of a little nervous emotions. I don't think there are really devils or ghosts, or anything else. The only thing we may sometimes think mysterious is just our spirit.

So my friend, don' t trust anything like that. Trust yourself!"
,"Why would you want to see how it feels to be possessed? Possession is real, the spiritual world is real, and many people take it so lightly.

The only purpose that satan has for us is to destroy us, and to influence us to destroy ourselves. This is no joke, hell is not a fairytale- please be careful what you wish for, my recommendation for you would be Bible study."
,"Possession is not a game. It is easy to become possessed but extremely difficult to get rid of that spirit. I am speaking from experience so don't even go there.

I would suggest you get possessed by the Holy spirit. You will never be the same. You will speak things you don't understand and do things you don't understand and dance and feel like there's no reason gravity should have any control over you.

It's so much more awesome than evil spirits. Try that dude. Either which way your soul goes to whoever possesses it. Think about that too."
,"Since the idea of possession is anti-scientific and goes against all that humans have learned about how psychiatric disorders work, the best answer perhaps it to say that you can just assume that you are not possessed. In the past people with metal illness were said to be 'possessed'. Our culture has thankfully moved beyond those times.
Science and medicine have shown us that events and diseases have natural sources, not supernatural."
,"Wwjd4iana, according to you, most of the world is possessed then, because why on earth would anyone who is not a Christian say that? Such a declaration of faith would be compromising their own beliefs."
,You have to be easy to manipulate. You are not. You are thinking too much.
,"Turn to JESUS, He is the only one that can SAVE you & His name is the only name that can cast out the demons in your life!! I will pray for you!!! God bless!"
,"What happens if you want it to happen, I have read the Bible and I have gone to church a bit actually and to me it's all because I believe that the devil is more real and more alive then God himself

Look at the world and what's happening to those people who didn't deserve (and children) or didn't ask to die but yet your GOD is so easily ready to decide who lives and who dies. There is no right or wrong, it's called CHOICE.

So those of you who read the Bible and believe in GOD good for you but you know what your kid/s could be walking home from school and get hit by a car who is the first person you blame after the driver- GOD

So leave the preaching to those who go to church..I believe in the devil and everything that goes with it, it might be bad but at least you know you're going to die, not live a lie believing in something that is going to kill us all and hide behind a cross."
,"You don't want to be possessed its like someone doing their bidding while you get the bad end of the deal( mostly death). You won't feel anything because you will black out and won't remember.

I haven't been possessed before or anybody else but I bet it won't be a fun ride."
,"Devils are real. We Catholics believe that. Even in other religion there is evidence that there were and are devils.

Yes, they are right - being possessed is not a joke. It will make your life miserable and may cause your death.

To those who don't believe that there are devils even if you're not a Catholic just read the Bible."
,"I believe the devil is in all of us, but sometimes the devil wants some of us
to have a higher percentage of evil. I don't think just anyone can be possessed,
only those worth possessing and corrupting.

I, for example am evil at heart. I feel like the only thing stopping me from doing terrible things is the law. Because of this demons will ignore me, knowing that sooner or later I will show how evil I can be.

You want to be possessed, and from that I can deduce that you are on the evil side of the spectrum, and are less likely to be possessed. So I guess you're shit outta luck, pal"
is president Donald Trump the Devil 666?,"I don't personally believe in any entity that is responsible for ""Evil"".
I do believe he is a self serving narcissistic person, who's selfish pride now effects billions rather then just himself.
If I thought he believed in an ""After Life"" . . . He is trying to make the loudest explosion possible to get his father's attention."
,I’m surprise none of the people who said Obama was the Antichrist are correlating TRUMP to the TRUMPets being blown when the world ends.

my boyfriend likes his co-worker and is bringing her food and taking care of her at work. what do i do?,"Does he know that you know he likes her? If so ask him who he wants more. Do It confidently and don’t let him weasel his way out of the question. I know it seems like a tough and rude approach, but I’d want to know that."
,"I'd say have it out with him, tell him it bothers u and make him choose: U or her. However, if he chooses her, u haven't lost much.
Just to be that way about it, go shake her hand and thank her for showing u what he really is. (Provided he chooses her )"
,"What do you mean ""likes her?"" Cuz bringing someone food and taking care of them at work doesn't automatically mean the two are doing the horizontal mattress mambo! If that was the case then all nurses and nannies would be single or unemployed...."
Do you feel bad for poor people?," Poor ppl r often - not always, victims and have little if any say so in their own finances. So yes.
On the other hand, ppl like donald trump made their bed, let 'em lie in it. Its nobodys fault but their own."
,Im poor but i kind of enjoy it its better than being filthy rich
,"Yes and no. I feel bad for people who didn’t have a choice. I don’t feel bad for people who had choices but made the wrong ones. And then there’s those who are content with what they have, if they’re happy why should I feel bad?"

Can Anyone Explain The Difference Between Engineered Wood Floors And Hardwood Floors?,"Engineered wood floors are man-made (think plywood) in layers and glued/epoxied/or heat-joined. While to the layman's eye there isn't a world of difference in their looks (there is a difference tho'), engineered floors are usually more scratch/wear resistant than real solid wood floors. However, if you gouge or deeply scratch an engineered floor, the difference in the layers will be evident whereas a solid wood floor is basically the same color throughout the plank. Some engineered wood is water resistant, but to my knowledge none is water proof. When an engineered floor gets soaked, as in a flood, the floor pieces begin to separate and curl (ugly) real wood floors, if properly attached, will not ""come apart"", but it will warp/shrink/mold overtime. But with real wood, you can REsand REshape and REfinish the floor...with engineered wood you can only REplace! Hope this helps... :)"
How do you clean hardwood floors?,"If the floors have been sanded and finished, there are numerous ways to clean hardwood floor so best check with nearest hardware store like Lowes and Home Depot for ideas and materials"
,"Depends on the finish coat, but most of the time pine sol is alright to use. You can also try warm water and soap. But as the person above said check with your local hardware stores. Hope this helps."
"I’m a freshman and I like a boy. Last year on the last day of school I sent my friend to tell him I liked him, which I then avoided him the rest of the day out of nervousness. What should I say when randomly messaging him out of the blue?",Yes I agree. You have remained hidden too much already. Its time to face your fears.
,"You don't.
If you can't talk to him in person, you shouldn't text him ""out of the blue"" ... Especially after being such a jerk last year.  (Yeah.  What you did was a jerk move.)"
