I don't think you're ready to be having any sex until you understand the basics of human biology. How old are you???"
1,"First of all I will suggest you to take pregnancy test . It very easy go to any medicine store [ pharmacy] and buy a pregnancy test gadget and test own your own. There must be a manual guide to learn more how to use .
And second as you said you're a girl and you had sex with your girlfriend that's mean she is girl too. So there is no possibility to get pregnant . Why there is no chance ? Because an pregnancy ussaly happened after a sex with a male . Becuase
Getting pregnant (conception) happens when a man’s sperm fertilises a woman’s egg. Read more
So I think there is no chance .
If you feel sick you must take some medicine and for sure must visit a doctor . I think its your health disorder there is nothing to do having sex with your gf and those are not a pregnancy symptoms."

1,"Essay writing structure
Composing an academic essay entails fashioning a coherent pair of ideas to a debate. Due to the fact essays are essentially linear--they feature one idea at a period--they should show their thoughts in the arrangement which makes most sense into an individual reader. Properly structuring an essay signifies attending into a reader's logic.
The focus of this kind of essay predicts its arrangement. It dictates that the advice readers will need to know and the arrangement where they will need to receive it. So your article's structure is fundamentally unique for the most important claim you're earning. Although you can find guidelines for building certain traditional essay types (e.g., comparative analysis), there are no set system.
Answering Inquiries: The Sections of a Essay
A common article has various sorts of advice, frequently situated in technical components or segments. Even limited essays function a number of different surgeries: Introducing the debate, analyzing data, increasing counter-arguments, concluding. Introductions and decisions have mended places, however, other parts do not. Counterargument, for example, can happen within just a paragraph, either being a freestanding segment, as part of the onset, or even before the end. Background materials (historical context or biographical info, a summary of appropriate criticism or theory, this is of a essential term) usually appears in the beginning of the essay, between your debut and also the first analytical department, but may possibly also appear near the start of the specific portion to which it truly is related.
It is helpful to consider about those different essay segments as answering a succession of questions that your reader might ask when restricting your thesis. (Readers have to have queries. Should they don't, the thesis is the most likely only an observation of reality, maybe not an arguable claim.)
""What?"" The very first question to anticipate from your reader would be ""what"": What signs proves the phenomenon clarified by your thesis is true? To answer this question you must examine your evidence, so demonstrating the truth of one's claim. This really ""exactly what"" or ""demonstration"" part includes early in this essay, often shortly after this debut. As you're in essence reporting exactly what you've seen, here could be the area you've got to say about when you begin producing. But you have to be forewarned: It willn't take up much more compared to a third (usually much less) of the finished essay. Should it, the article may lack equilibrium and could see as mere summary or description.
""How?"" A reader may also desire to understand if the claims of this thesis are authentic in all situations. The corresponding challenge would be ""how"": Just how can the thesis stand until the challenge of a counterargument? Exactly how does the introduction of new stuff--a brand new direction of looking at the signs, yet another set of sources--affect that the claims you are making? On average, an article will probably comprise atleast ""how"" area. (phone it ""complication"" as you're responding to a reader's complicating questions) This section usually arrives after the ""what,"" but keep in your mind that an article may reevaluate its debate a couple times depending on its span, and that counter argument alone could appear almost everywhere within a essay.
Your writer will also want to know what is at stake on your claim: Why can your interpretation of the phenomenon thing to anybody beside you personally? This question covers the larger consequences of one's thesis. It enables your audience to comprehend your own essay in just a bigger context. In answering ""why"", your essay explains a unique significance. Although you could gesture in this question in the introduction, the fullest reply to this comes at your essay's conclude. If you abandon it out, your subscribers may experience your essay too incomplete--or worse, even as moot or insular.
Mapping an Essay
Structuring your essay according to a reader logic means assessing your thesis along with trusting exactly what your reader needs to learn, and in what arrangement, as a way to comprehend and be convinced from your debate because it evolves. Easy and simple way to do so is to map the article's notions with a published story. Such an account can provide you a preliminary list of your thoughts, and enable one to remind yourself in every turn of the reader's needs in understanding your thought.
Essay maps request that you predict where your reader may expect background information, counter argument, close identification of the main source, or an alternate twist to secondary origin stuff. Composing maps aren't worried about paragraphs so muchas having sections within an essay writing. They expect the key argumentative moves you expect your composition to generate. Try making your map such as that:
    Condition your thesis at a sentence or 2, then compose a second sentence expressing why it is vital to create certain assert. Indicate, to put it differently, what a reader could know by researching the claim with you. Here you are expecting your answer to this ""why"" issue you will finally flesh out in your conclusion.
    Begin your next sentence like that: ""To be convinced with my own argue, very first thing that a reader should understand is ..."" Then say why this is very first thing a reader needs to know, and title a couple of items of evidence which you think will produce the situation. This will start off you on answering the ""what"" issue. (alternatively, you can come to realize that very first thing your reader has to understand is a few background details.)
    Start every one of the subsequent sentences like this: ""Next thing my reader needs to learn is why ..."" Once again, state, and then name some evidence. Continue till you have mapped out on that your own essay.
Your map should naturally take you as a result of several preliminary responses to the standard questions about what, how, and the reason why. It is not a contract, even nevertheless--that the arrangement in which the ideas appear isn't just a stiff one. Composing maps are elastic; nevertheless they develop along with your thoughts.
Signals of Difficulty
A common structural flaw in college essays is that the ""walkthrough"" (also labeled ""summary"" or ""outline""). Walkthrough essays follow the structure of the sources rather than establishing their particular personal. Such essays generally have a descriptive thesis as opposed to an 1. Be skeptical of paragraph openers that lead off with ""time"" phrases (""original,"" ""next,"" ""afterwards,"" ""afterward"") or even ""listing"" words (""too,"" ""a second,"" ""also""). Even though they don't necessarily indicate trouble, these paragraph timers usually indicate that a composition's thesis and structure require function: They imply that the composition only imitates the chronology of this source text (at the case of keywords: First this comes to pass, then, and later another thing ... ) or lists example after example (""Additionally the use of color signals another manner which the painting differentiates between nice and wicked"")."
1,"A clear introduction with a well defined structure, Logically structured body paragraphs which include supporting evidence from academic sources. A clear conclusion which restates your topic and summarizes your essay and thesis.
A basic essay consists of three main parts: Introduction, body, and conclusion. Following this format will help you write and organize an essay. However, flexibility is important. While keeping this basic essay format in mind, let the topic and specific assignment guide the writing and organization.
Parts of an Essay
Introduction : The introduction guides your reader into the paper by introducing the topic. It should
begin with a hook that catches the reader’s interest.
Thesis Statement:
The thesis statement concisely states the main idea or argument of the essay, sets
limits on the topic, and can indicate the organization of the essay.
Body :
The body of the essay supports the main points presented in the thesis. Each point is
developed by one or more paragraphs and supported with specific details. These
details can include support from research and experiences, depending on the
assignment.
Transitions
Transitions connect paragraphs to each other and to the thesis. They are used within and between
paragraphs to help the paper flow from one topic to the next. These transitions can be one or two words
(“first,” “next,” “in addition,” etc.) or one or two sentences that bring the reader to the next main point.
Conclusion
The conclusion brings together all the main points of the essay. It refers back to the thesis statement
and leaves readers with a final thought and sense of closure by resolving any ideas brought up in the
essay. It may also address the implications of the argument. In the conclusion, new topics or ideas that
were not developed in the paper should not be introduced.
Citations
If your paper incorporates research, be sure to give credit to each source using in-text citations and a
Works Cited/References/Bibliography page. Refer to the MLA Format, APA Format, or Turabian Format

1,Try changing brands of shampoo and conditioner. Certain ones just don't work for my hair. Also (for me) it can depend on the time of year. Like right now (the start of winter) my hair is so dry. Even though it's the same shampoo and conditioner I use for summer.
1,"I have a seemingly counterintuitive suggestion: Of course if you’re not shampooing regularly already, you should shampoo more often.
However, if you ARE shampooing regularly, and it’s not working, I would suggest trying to CUT DOWN on shampooing. Shampooing strips hair of natural oils, and your scalp may produce more and more as a result.
Search up “no -poo”, there communities of people doing this and it works for them. Might not work for everyone.
Also, use dry shampoo!!! Basically it’s alcohol and powder in a aerosol can. Spray it in your hair, wait 3 minutes, then comb it all out. It rids all the oil and germs. There’s even dark dry shampoo for dark hair! (Lol I discovered it just this month and it’s really improved my hair situation.) If it works good on my long hair, I can imagine it’ll work even better for shorter hair.
If your hair gets too dry, take a tiny bit of coconut oil and comb that over the ends of your hair (not the scalp). Wash every other day, or if you sweat/get dirty. Otherwise, shower but put on a shower cap (or a walmart bag like i do...it’s very loud though)."

Unfortunately, it's slightly more complicated than that. Indeed, most burglars tend to use brute force rather dexterity to gain entry. More crude battering ram than hair pin, to be honest.

The only people that can successfully pick any kind of secure lock is a locksmith and he will need something called a skeleton key to do so. Or rather a whole bunch of skeletons keys until the lock opens.

In any case, most modern locks are not designed to be easily picked. Not like the days of old when there were certain cars that would start with the key off a corned beef tin."

I am sorry, but your answer lacks any insight or basic knowledge regarding lock smithing. I guess you have never witnessed a lock smith manipulating a secured lock in lieu of a key. You might be surprised to learn that a lock smith can actually ""pick"" the lock using a ""lock pick"". However, you do not necessarily need to be a lock smith to ""pick"" a lock. With a lot of patience and considerable practice, anyone can learn to pick a lock without the formal training received by the lock smith.

In some cases, the associated tools of the trade may not be required. For instance, given the scenario, the only tool that may be needed is a credit card. Using a credit card, however, to compress the locking mechanism would not technically be considered ""picking the lock"" but rather deemed ""breaking and entering""."

1,"Lock picking is defined as the manipulation of a lock's components to open the lock without a normal key. Therefore to pick a lock successfully one must understand the principles of both lock and key. A standard deadbolt lock consists of pins tumblers that are rotated by the key to open the lock. Most locks are similar in concept so learning this method of lock picking will serve you well. 

Buy a practice lock. Get a standard five-pin deadbolt lock that can be disassembled. 
Remove all but the first pin closest to the front of the lock.
The way to pick a door lock is by maneuvering the pin tumblers to the sheer line. The sheer line is a mechanism of measurement that tells the lock it is okay to open. As a key lifts the first pin it tumbles into its sheer line groove, the key is already entering the gap of the second pin, and so on.
Fashion the pick tool. Pick tools can be made from a straightened paperclip, the flat end of a hairpin, or a tiny flathead screwdriver. They can also be fashioned out of straight or safety pins, or an industrial staple.
Turn the lock upside down and watch as gravity pulls the pin down. This shows where to insert the pick and apply gentle pressure downward. When you hit the sheer line, the plug will turn and the student will know the feel and pressure needed to release a pin. Turn the lock right side up and practice.
Once the one pin has been mastered, add another pin back into the lock. Close the lock and try again. If the first pin is not released, the second pin cannot be engaged. Keep practicing and adding pins until all five are back in the lock.
With concentrated focus on the lock picking, mastery of this technique can take as little as an hour.  The more pins that a lock has, the sturdier the pick will need to be.

One never knows where and when a lock will need to be picked.  However, mastering the art of lock picking may get an individual back into their own car or home without incurring the expense of calling a locksmith."

Despite how convenient it may sound, losing weight ""quickly"" would probably not feel as rewarding for long. More like a short lived impulse that after it happens, turns into a down feeling. If you take the process duration and plan it you will feel happier once you accomplish it. Knowing your planned determination was a result of doing properly (long route) it also builds a sense of control once the results progress.
A lot of people have told me they felt that ""now what"" feeling after quickly rushing off their weight goals like you're talking about. I think if you want to, you can lose 20 pounds. But can you find a way to urgently cheat through it..? Probably not. Im sure its possible though. Maybe you could.
Just don't accept any easy routes as truth. Most of stuff you'll hear online will be lies and unsafe and the other 20% scams. Id say 80% of the methods you will hear online are false.

0,Oh my !  Ho did this person gain 20 pounds so quickly?
1,"You didn't gain it quickly, so don't expect to lose it quickly.  The proper way is to eat a well balanced, well portioned diet. Stay hydrated and get at least 8 hours of sleep.  Also get 30 minutes of exercise everyday. Just walk. It is free and easy to do. If you don't have 30 minutes at one time, do two 15 minute walks or three 10 minute walks."
1,"Create a Calorie deficit.
Figure out what you are consuming daily and reduce it by 200 to 300 calories if you are maintaining weight, and not gaining weight.
Add in at least 10,000 steps a day and you will lose weight. Since you didn't gain it overnight, do not expect to lose it overnight.   "
1,"I believe you should focus more on eating healthy and getting proper nutrition than simply losing weight. You will lose weight along the way, which is good, but to strive to eat healthy for the sake of it is more of a lifestyle than a goal. If you tried to just lose weight, then it is likely you will gain it back once you've lost if your goal is a particular destination rather than an overall health habit change. Also, just because you're eating enough to lose doesn't necessarily equate to eating good.
Additionally, it is important to know that even though items may have the same about of calories in them, doesn't mean that they're equally as fattening contrary to popular belief. You actually burn foods like almonds faster than crackers even if you intake the same amount of calories of either.
Also, stay clear of ""diet"" foods. Special ""K"" chips, fat free cookies, etc. They're actually worse for you, and in order to make them ""fat free"" or ""sugar free"" they either have to load in tons of sugar or artificial sweetener, which is the real devil here. Eat some real food and not factory-crap advertised as good for diets.
(Added) Sugar is the biggest perpetrator in obesity. It does not carry nutrients or anything humans need in it, but it is very fattening, addicting, and causes cravings and hunger. In fact, sugar is more addicting than heroin, which can perhaps paint a picture on the extent sugar is what causes cravings and misleading hunger signals, making it detrimental to our health. So try to limit sugar, yet don't get sweets and junk food that is labeled ""sugar free."" They contain artificial sweeteners, which is worse for you even though they don't taste nearly as good."
1,"In order to lose wait follow these steps:
Consult with a medical professional
Determine if you actually need to lose weight, and if so, how much
Make sure you’re doing it for the right reasons
Be realistic about losing weight fast
Make your health your priority
Limit restaurant meals
Get plenty of exercises
Drink a lot of water
Stop drinking your calories
Avoid fad diets"
1,"I love having earrings in, and because my body heals no matter what, I always have my earrings in.

I also adore my college ring, and on certain occasions I will wear a necklace."
1,"In the following order my angel [lol]:
ankle bracelet
earrings [tho I only have room for 8]
rings [tho only room for 10]
toe rings
necklace
bracelet
Tada! [[[hugs]]]] ?Nassy"
1,"I wear 14 earrings... Yep 14...10 diamond studs and 4 small gold hoops. I have7 studs and 2 hoops in my left ear, and 3 studs and 2 hoops in my right ear. I also wear 4 rings all the time, My engagement ring on my left hand, and on my right I have a Lindy star, my birthstone, and my Daddy's wedding ring. I wear a diamond heart necklace that mt Fiancee' gave me for valentine's day 6 years ago, and only take it off when I want to wear something different for a special occasion. When Im dressed up, Ill wear bracelets. They tend to get in the way and I always end up taking them off if I try to wear them everyday, and they end up in my purse...although I have some nice ones and I love them. I never take my earrings out...unless Im forced to for x-rays or something... And The only time I take my rings off is when Im working on the wheel... I hate getting mud caked in my rings, and they tend to gouge the clay."
1,"I like earrings the most, I like to have a dainty necklace on to go with my outfits, too. I like my watch but never bracelets, unless my little 10 yr. Old gives me one, which he has and I wore it alot but it started looking wore out so I put it in my jewelry box so I can keep it safe forever. He liked that I will keep it forever..."
1,"I love necklaces, they are definitely my all time favorite piece of jewelry. When getting dress i put on the other stuff at second thought (if i can remember at all) but i usually always have a necklace on. There was this one black string one with a metal moon painted black that chris gave me and i didn't take that off for months. Its probably my favorite necklace or piece of jewelry at all for that matter of all time. Mainly because it holds the best memory. :)"
1,I do not feel dressed without earrings.
1,"Earrings, DEFINITELY. I hardly EVER take mine out. I love them! Next best for me is a ring, then necklace, then bracelet. I like bracelets, but their not my favorite."
1,I haven't removed my earrings in a long time and rarely wear jewelry... I occasionally will wear a necklace or bracelet but haven't worn a ring since high school...
1,"I love rings and necklaces. I have one ring I NEVER take off. And I just love the way necklaces look. I like bracelets, but sometimes they just get in the way."
1,Earrings- people always look at your face (and legs) so you get a lot of attention and competition with cutest earrings and some earrings will go well with your face and make you look prettier :)
1,I go with earring's.. Where its not that affecting my work.. As a nurse .. Jewelry is a no no.. Only wedding ring and earring's.. I prefer earring's.. Tongue ring and nose studs.. ;p
1,"Well, i prefer everything. I have on four necklaces, i wear bracelets on my left wrist and my watch by itself on my right wrist. I wear four rings, two on each side. I have a toe ring. When i dress up, i usually put in earrings. :)"
1,Lol my mom LOVES jewelry she loves ALL of them lol. Well me I don't really know.. AGAIN lol! Sorry lol!
1,"Depends on what kind of bracelet or ring or what have you. Right now I am currently wearing a leather bracelet, a small snake ring on my pointer finger, a wristband from Rock the Universe, and a necklace from Kingdom Hearts 2 that my boyfriend gave me. I don't have any part of my body pierced, so therefore I am not a fan of earrings."
1,"I always wear a jewellery & I lovely like a Diamond & gold jewellery. Like a Bracelet, Necklace, Pendant, Earring, Bangles, Nose pin, ladies Rings, etc."
1,"If i have to say i completely interested in Rings, i should say that i am more obsessed with the rings. I wear almost 6 to 7 rings to my fingers. My one finger has 3 rings and the rest of the 4 to other fingers. Whenever i go to shopping my eyes only go on Rings there. More than the clothes i think i have rings with me.
I do shop rings online at online stores like Bluestone. I just choose what i like the most and will order them online. I do get discount with Bluestone Coupons."
1,"Lol, I like all diamond jewellery,"
1,"""Happy birthday"" is actually the same for a girl and a boy in French - the word ""anniversaire"" is always masculine, so its modifier - the ""happy"" part - is too.

There are two possible ways of saying ""happy birthday"" in French:
Joyeux anniversaire!
Bon anniversaire!
These two are totally interchangeable, so it doesn't matter which you use. Quite often, when wishing somebody happy birthday online or in a text message, people will just write ""bon anniv,"" which is just an abbreviation of ""bon anniversaire.""

Other Birthday-Related Phrases in French
Mon anniversaire - My birthday
Un gâteau d'anniversaire - A birthday cake
Une carte d'anniversaire - A birthday card
Des cadeaux d'anniversaire - Birthday presents
Quelle est la date de ton anniversaire? - When is your birthday?

Singing ""Happy Birthday"" In French The French sing ""Joyeux Anniversaire"" to the same tune that we sing ""Happy Birthday."" The French version goes like this:

Joyeux anniversaire Joyeux anniversaire Joyeux anniversaire (you might insert the birthday girl/boy's name here)
Joyeux anniversaire!"
1,"To send someone your birthday greetings in Italian, you only really need one word: Auguri!

This word is the shortened version of the slightly more laborious auguri di buon compleanno.

The word auguri comes from the verb augurare which means 'to wish'- so the closest English expression would probably be something like 'best wishes'.

Like the term 'best wishes', auguri is not limited to use for birthdays. Instead, it is used at various occasions in Italian and is often the first word you'll hear at the chime of midnight when people are welcoming in a new year.

If you want to extend birthday greetings especially fervently, you may want to modify auguri with the superlatve suffix -oni. In Italian, this suffix is used to denote great size, so auguroni would be the word for 'great big birthday wishes'.

Alternatively, you could use the indefinite adjective tanti meaning 'many' to say tanti auguri.
The expression tanti auguri is also the title of the Italian song 'happy birthday' and is a phrase that often decorates birthday cards and banners that you might buy at the local cartoleria or 'stationery shop'..

One final option is to simply say buon compelanno meaning 'happy birthday'- the main thing is to remember to say something!

If you do forget someone's birthday, you may find this page helpful in redeeming yourself."
1,"A private education can have many advantages.
Private education offers the chance for a child to grow in terms of personal development and confidence.
Many private schools are highly academic and are ideal for a motivated, academic student. However many private schools are less academically focused and aim to provide a good all round education for children on a variety of levels rather than being purely academic.
State schools are not always in good catchment areas and private education can ensure that the majority of the classes are full of motivated pupils in many cases.
Personal development is highly valued and children get more individual attention in the private sector.
The downside is that students at private schools do not mix with a wide mixture of other children from different backgrounds and may have a narrower perspective on a range of social issues. Conversely some may argue that this is a positive in favour of the private sector.
One disadvantage which is a major one is cost. Many parents and children are at a disadvantage because of the cost of fees which are usually very high - the present Labour Government withdrew assisted place funding which benefited many gifted children.
There are some scholarships and bursaries available but the competition for them is high."
0,Advantages And Disadvantages Of A Private Education
0,Disadvantages of private schools in Nigeria
1,"Positives:
Small class sizes.
Impressive test scores (not always, though).
A wider variety of extra-curricular on-site opportunities (not always)
A smaller tightly knit school community.
Not necessarily tied to the National Curriculum (some independent schools follow it, anyway).
Not required to sit SATs.

Negatives:
High cost (for most a consideration!).

""Keeping up with the Jones'"": if your child's classmates are wealthy and manifest that wealth, will your child feel left out if your family doesn't have as much money?

Many private schools do not require their teachers to have the same level of achievement or accreditation as is required in the state sector.

Cultural or social isolation: your child will probably a larger range of other types of people in a state school.

Being tapped for money: if you thought the state sector schools are always fund-raising, that's not a patch on the work that private schools have to do to get extra money in.

Can be bad or good
Hot-housing: not an issue everywhere, but do you want your child in an environment with high academic expectations? What if that's not what they're like?

Formality (independents are usually more formally run)."

1,"If your aim is to improve your aptitude and knowledge base in a particular field, all education pertaining to this subject will useful. If this statement is assumed true, then the benefits afforded by private tuition are enormous. You will have the advantage of a whole teacher to yourself, with their lesson plans and strategies of teaching designed just for you! It seems impossible to doubt the enormous benefits this will offer. In a classroom, one teacher may be faced with around thirty pupils, each with different abilities, different rates of learning, and individual strengths and weaknesses; yet despite this, for the majority of the lesson the teacher will be forced to treat his class as if it contained just one student. He or she will orate from one end of the classroom, unable to gauge how effectively each pupil is assimilating the lesson. The lesson plans will be designed to fit the needs of the average pupil; and the teacher will proceed at a rate suitable for the average pupil.
In this environment it is all to easy for a bright child or adolescent to fail to grasp one particular point, as the swathe of teacher talk washes over them like the unrelenting tides. It is unlikely even the best of teachers would spot the particular point of misunderstanding cast on the countenance on one pupil, hidden amongst so many other faces. To draw attention to their lack of understanding can be intimidating for the pupil: Everyone else is silent, so they must have understood. Do I want to draw attention to myself? All too often the misunderstanding goes unexpressed and unaided. The obvious benefit of one to one tuition is that the tutor can tailor their teaching style to the abilities of their student. They will be able to gauge the level of the pupils understanding, and, more importantly, track down the sources of misunderstanding, and deal with them effectively. Away from the bustle of the classroom, the student will feel more able to voice their difficulties; and having just one pupil to deal with, the teacher will be more capable of resolving them.
Compared to the conflicts of the classroom, fraught with distractions and intimidations from other pupils, the relaxed environment of tutor and student can be a safe haven of erudition. Most tutors will be willing to travel to the pupil's house, allowing them the benefit of learning in a happy home location.A tutor will be able to focus their teaching on a particular area: The pupil may be very competent in mathematics overall, but be deficient in calculus, with this specific weakness undermining their whole confidence in the subject. Maybe they are highly literate and proficient in English language, but shy away from public speaking. The syllabus may demand some oral work (foreign languages certainly do), so it would be a shame if this particular and minor deficiency detracted from their overall grade in the subject. Even if the pupil is performing well at school or college, it is highly likely that some private tuition will give then the edge over their peers. For it is their friends and contemporaries that they are competing against - many of whomay already be receiving tuition. In an age where extra tuition is almost becoming the norm, it may be necessary to join in, or risk being left behind. "

1,"At this stage of the game, it doesn’t really matter whether or not he’s cheating or she is cheating. You suspect that he/she is. Whether you’re right or wrong about that, you clearly don’t trust him/ her .So the lack of evidence proves nothing to you.Then, you’ll conclude that he’s even craftier than you thought, and he’s covering up too well to get caught.....
Contact : Spycyjones (at) gmail (dot) com 
People I know, cheaters I know react to their partners ' accusations by cheating on them even more. So...be sure of it, have proof because as soon as you say something about it, and it happens to not be true...it is going to change the relationship. BUT if you have good reasons and maybe even proof, it would make the relationship come into the light of what it really is. The change was already brought in by him/her and not you in that situation.
Good luck

1,"Improvement of website ranking without
spending a bomb depends purely on the nature of the website, its expanse, and
the professionals you get in touch with. Any web design company Dubai

has to offer, nowadays designs websites
that are SEO friendly. So if you have recently developed a website, then
chances are that half the work of SEO optimization is already done, and you
need not worry about beginning everything from scratch. Having said this, it is
first necessary to carry the audit of the website such that you will be able to
understand what is missing, and what is not. Second step would be to proceed
with a list of things you can do, and things that will be affordable for you to
do on the SEO front.
A web design agency Dubai has to offer will help you with the onpage optimization
as their bunch of experts are skilled to take the task of changing the metrics
of websites. But that is not the complete solution to improve your SEO ranking
in search engine results pages. For that, you will need to optimize the content
based on the targeted keywords, optimize the rankings through off-page
activities. For this, the SEO services of agencies and those provided by
individual experts vary. You may opt for an individual expert, if you want slow
results. But for better and effective results, you will eventually have to
spend more. If you have the budget, I suggest you go with an agency as they
have good resources when it comes to SEO optimization, and everything is done
in-house at most agencies to get better and faster results."

1,"I don't know a lot of thirteen year olds right now but I never knew dads like that. Maybe he feels okay with it around you because your family and/or home is where he believes he can do things like that because he feels secure there and/or he is your general weirdo. It could be a general male thing like, ""I can do whatever I want because I am a man!"". In other words, lazy.

Does he do it when your mother is at home? If not, talk about it with your mother because some dads get angry. Why? Because in their mind, it's logical to get mad at this because you're being disrespectful and this and that and blah blah blah.

If your dad is not a creeper or a mean dude, then ask him not to do that around you in a sort of scared child manner. Say you are really uncomfortable about it. Remember to say it nicely and not accusatory or in a negative manner. Say it with confusion. That usually works when my stubborn dad won't listen to me.

If both parents are unreasonable and won't be able to understand that you want him to stop walking around the house in only a towel, you're going to have to deal with it. Sorry but just ignore it and everything else, because there'll be more later on.  I know it sounds unfair but you're going to have to be the best of what humanity has to offer while your parents are not. Just concentrate on college, financial stability, and friends. Live a happy life. Peace! :3"

1,"It is probably just accident only cover, but it will do no harm to double check if you are unsure what type of policy you have.

Have a look at the small print and Terms & Conditions document you would have been given at the time of opening the life insurance policy. There should be some kind of indication that can tell if you if the policy is Term, Whole Life or Accident Cover.

You should also been in receipt of regular company literature or statements from your policy provider. Scan any letters with a fine tooth and look for any clues about the type of policy you hold. If there is a contact telephone number or an advisor named in the letter in the event you need to get in touch; try to get hold of them. There should also be a policy document number that you may need to quote when making any correspondence.

If you still cannot find any information, the best thing to do is to get in touch with Allicins Life Insurance. If they are unable to help they may direct you to speak to Sears Insurance.

Here are the following contact details you may need when getting in touch with Sears:

Last January I bumped my leg in my shop.  I have something called Charcot Marie Tooth Sysdrome.  This causes little or knowfeeling in my legs-  the bump turned into a sore.  When I noticed it during my shower I washed it treated it and bandaged it.  It healed but 3 months later it came back. I cleaned it, treated it, and it healed, BUT it came back.  Long story short I passed out in my bedroom and layer about 3 hours on the floor..  I came to my wife was there with a fireman. The out again.  I came to in the ER in time to hear the doctor tell my wife and son that they were flying me to a trauma hospital  because the only organs I had that were still working were my brain, heart, and lungs.  The doctor told my famil that I wouldn’t make it to the other hospital I would be DOA before the plane landed.  While flying over the Rocky Mtns, I had my 3rd heart attack.  The leg wound caused it all, it turned to an infection, which turned into sepsis, which turned to gangrene of the leg.  They kept cutting parts of my leg away, three surgeons wanTed to cut it off because it morphed into  Flash Estinfilm Virus!  Moved To o wound hospital  they cut 15 square inches off the leg about 3/4” Deep.  Total of 59 leg surgeries, plus Gallbladder removal surgery, Bladder surgery, Eye surgery, skin graphs, and heart surgery!  Today my doctors released me To a normal Life.  I still have my leg, looks diferent than the other but i still have it.  How do I handle life crushing news. Prayer, God that still performs Miracles, and a lot of good friends who , kept me going through kind words and prayer,  Thank you all, isn’t enough"

1,"I do little short bursts. Maybe with a closer friend, you could drag it out that long (you mean start talking randomly and not establishing an end right?) but usually you ask them about something, then follow with a little chat. If they seem uninterested, maybe check the topic? Or you could end it with an “I’m going to sleep now, ttyl”
End it when you feel like you have to end it."
1,Why would you want to drag out a conversation? Just talk to the person for a bit and come back later.  Most people get bored over chit chat.
1,"Scared?
Then don't have sex because you are not ready."
1,"Woah! Not cool. You guys are way too young for sex. I dunno what the law is like where you live, but most places it is downright illegal to have sex at that age. Just wait."
1,At 12 years old you should not be thinking of having sex with anybody I have to think the 14 year old boyfriend is pressuring you to do this.  It is against the law and you could both end up in trouble.  It's against the law for a reason and that's because you're still a child and not ready to make these decisions yet.  Please listen to the advice you've got here because you're going to get really messed up if you give in to this.
1,"I mean, if you wnat to then you want to but you should probably be alone together and in a goooood spot. Closets work well (kay, maybe not, but you gotta admit nobody will see you)"
1,"If you are scared then you are not ready.
At least one of the two of you have the sense to have condoms and know how to safely use them...I hope."
1,Well...of course you are scared and you should be. Your bf should even be more afraid. Him getting caught having sex with you can get him arrested and ending up on a sexual predator list. You are entirely too young to be making such a decision. Not to mention the risks.  There are STDs. If you should get one then you hace to tell someone so you can get treated. You are not even a teenager yet. You cannot get medical attention without a parent or guardian. You need to wait.
0,I don't know if they still do the Pledge Of Allegiance in school anymore or not. Any day that involves chocolate is  my kind of day! Hi Otis!
1,"Most do, I think some teachers don’t make the kids do it. They do in our high school."
1,"California done away with it. Stupid California! When I still had one of my kids in school all the principal said over the intercom was ""ready begin"" followed by a minute of silence! Screw them!

1,"I think so.
I never see a teenager without a phone in their hand.
I never see children playing.
Most of them can't carry on a conversation with you."
1,Yes this generation has it all mixed up. Everything is on the computer
1,Try changing brands of shampoo and conditioner. Certain ones just don't work for my hair. Also (for me) it can depend on the time of year. Like right now (the start of winter) my hair is so dry. Even though it's the same shampoo and conditioner I use for summer.
1,"I have a seemingly counterintuitive suggestion: Of course if you’re not shampooing regularly already, you should shampoo more often.
However, if you ARE shampooing regularly, and it’s not working, I would suggest trying to CUT DOWN on shampooing. Shampooing strips hair of natural oils, and your scalp may produce more and more as a result.
Search up “no -poo”, there communities of people doing this and it works for them. Might not work for everyone.
Also, use dry shampoo!!! Basically it’s alcohol and powder in a aerosol can. Spray it in your hair, wait 3 minutes, then comb it all out. It rids all the oil and germs. There’s even dark dry shampoo for dark hair! (Lol I discovered it just this month and it’s really improved my hair situation.) If it works good on my long hair, I can imagine it’ll work even better for shorter hair.
If your hair gets too dry, take a tiny bit of coconut oil and comb that over the ends of your hair (not the scalp). Wash every other day, or if you sweat/get dirty. Otherwise, shower but put on a shower cap (or a walmart bag like i do...it’s very loud though)."
0,Don't put grease?
1,Shampoo often.  Use a shampoo designed to improve oily hair .... Almost every brand has a selection like that.

1,"I’m interested in how others handle life crushing  Some of you know what I’ve been through, others do not. If I may I would like to tell you how I handled the most life stressing year of my life.

It is against the law and you could both end up in trouble.  It's against the law for a reason and that's because you're still a child and not ready to make these decisions yet.  Please listen to the advice you've got here because you're going to get really messed up if you give in to this.
1,"I mean, if you wnat to then you want to but you should probably be alone together and in a goooood spot. Closets work well (kay, maybe not, but you gotta admit nobody will see you)"
1,"If you are scared then you are not ready.
At least one of the two of you have the sense to have condoms and know how to safely use them...I hope."
1,Well...of course you are scared and you should be. Your bf should even be more afraid. Him getting caught having sex with you can get him arrested and ending up on a sexual predator list. You are entirely too young to be making such a decision. Not to mention the risks.  There are STDs. If you should get one then you hace to tell someone so you can get treated. You are not even a teenager yet. You cannot get medical attention without a parent or guardian. You need to wait.

There's a website that I often refer to to help with this question along with others you may need answers to, jw.org. "
1,"ANONYMOUS.........THE SYMPTOMS OF TEEN DEPRESSION CAN APPEAR DURING ADOLESCENCE.
WHAT PARENTS CAN DO; 
Recognize that depressed teens may find it hard to express their feelings or may not understand what is happening to them. They may not even be aware of the symptoms of depression.
Teens tend to express their depression in ways different from those of adults, so be alert to major changes in your child’s behavior, eating habits, moods, sleep patterns, or social interactions—especially if the changes persist for weeks.
Take seriously any comments or hints regarding suicide.
If you suspect depression (not just the blues), consider getting a professional diagnosis.
Help your teen adhere to the doctor’s prescribed treatment, and consult the doctor if you see no improvement or observe unpleasant side effects.
Have a stable family routine for eating, exercising, and sleeping.
Maintain good communication with your teen, and help him or her to deal with any stigma associated with depression.
Because depression can make one feel alone, ashamed, or worthless, regularly reassure your teen of your love."

1,Neither one is good for me!  Makes you sweat.
1,"It isn't.
They both contribute to calorie loss and fat burning. Cardio and diet contribute to burning Visceral fat, whereas Lifting weights to create Lean Dense muscle contribute to burning more Subcutaneous fat.
More correctly, they both contribute to overall fat loss, but Cardio usually hits both. It is actually important to combine the two forms of exercise for a well balanced health.
Cardio also burns in the here and now whereas Weight lifting caloric burn, usually lasts for 24 to 48 hours depending upon the exercise. ""Dead Lifts"" and ""Squats"" are just two examples of weight training exercises that can burn calories up to 48 hours."

Choose light furniture with simple lines.

1,Try changing brands of shampoo and conditioner. Certain ones just don't work for my hair. Also (for me) it can depend on the time of year. Like right now (the start of winter) my hair is so dry. Even though it's the same shampoo and conditioner I use for summer.
1,"I have a seemingly counterintuitive suggestion: Of course if you’re not shampooing regularly already, you should shampoo more often.
However, if you ARE shampooing regularly, and it’s not working, I would suggest trying to CUT DOWN on shampooing. Shampooing strips hair of natural oils, and your scalp may produce more and more as a result.
Search up “no -poo”, there communities of people doing this and it works for them. Might not work for everyone.
Also, use dry shampoo!!! Basically it’s alcohol and powder in a aerosol can. Spray it in your hair, wait 3 minutes, then comb it all out. It rids all the oil and germs. There’s even dark dry shampoo for dark hair! (Lol I discovered it just this month and it’s really improved my hair situation.) If it works good on my long hair, I can imagine it’ll work even better for shorter hair.
If your hair gets too dry, take a tiny bit of coconut oil and comb that over the ends of your hair (not the scalp). Wash every other day, or if you sweat/get dirty. Otherwise, shower but put on a shower cap (or a walmart bag like i do...it’s very loud though)."
0,Don't put grease?
1,Shampoo often.  Use a shampoo designed to improve oily hair .... Almost every brand has a selection like that.
1,"No, you should not tell her.  It is there business.  I know its tough and you want to but it is not your business to tell her.  Guys and girls both cheat sometimes it is sad and awful but that is life.  She will probably eventually find out some other way.  Your brother is your family and you don't want to start problems.  Maybe if you still feel like telling her have her find out some other way that don't involve you or your friends or family and that it don't come back on.  Good luck and take care."
1,"That's a difficult question...it depends n what you are willing to deal with personally. What your brother is doing is terrible, but horribly commonplace. Should she know? Absolutely. The question is, are you willing to damage your relationship with your brother? Depending on how old he is, he will likely get over the 'betrayal' of you telling his girlfriend the truth, but in the meantime, his motto would be to keep out! Did you personally witness cheating, did he tell you, or did you suspect it? If you personally witnessed it and you feel she might be in some danger (STD's, etc.), perhaps try to remind your brother of the very selfish danger he's putting her in. I know it's hard, but remind him how angry and hurt he would feel if she betrayed him. It is up to you whether or not to confront him or her, but you have many options. Could you tell a parent and have them talk to him (without him knowing it was you)? It's true, it's their business, but the people being hurt rarely like to be the laughing stock as everyone stands around them and wonders..."
1,Listen to lisamarie1; that's one of the best answers I've seen on blurtit.
1,"Come on if you say he's your brother and you care about him; you should
tell him whats wrong in his relationship. But if you keep it to
yourself, you're not being loyal to him."
1,"No, you shouldn't tell her that.  You need to remain loyal to your brother in this regard, no matter how hard that may be and no matter how much he does stupid things.  Hopefully, he will eventually come around and realize he needs to get his act together. "
1,"Guys, listen...... !!!carefully.if you will never commit in a relationship, please never be in it.... Being liberal is a disease that does not have cure! I meant cancer you hear???. Anytime you cheat on somebody that dsz.... Will never go. Why? You have planted a seed and all it needs is your thought"
1,Don't get involved that will just create drama! Your brother will just get mad at you and that will start a whoe other problem. YOUR not the one who is at fault so YOU shouldn't have to clean up after your brother. However you should try to convince your brother to tell his girlfriend the truth. Hope this helps. Good Luck!

1,Don't get involved in other peoples business let your bro tell her it is his problem not yours
0,I going through the same dilemma
1,Yes!
1,"When you first start thinking a girl is cheating on you then there is obviously something wrong with your relationship and you will notice little things, like she does not answer your calls all the time. She will say she was in the bath/shower, or left it in other room, or the phone will be turned off and she will say the battery was flat.

Has she got a load of new friends that you have never heard of before or just one friend who she has not mentioned to you? When you query her she will say that she has told you about her, so then it starts putting doubts in your head and then you start to imagine it is you with the problem.

She starts to argue with you for no reason, and then storms out, accusing you of always starting arguments. Has she taken a bit more care of herself when going out, for example: Spending more time doing her hair, wearing best clothes when she is out with the girls, showing a bit more cleavage or a bit more leg?

Never let a girl who you are in a relationship with go to a nightclub without you, there is a reason she does not want you there. Lads are bad when they are out, but believe me girls are twenty times worse.

It is very easy for girls to get noticed and even if they are not the prettiest there is always some lad in any town who will want to brag about going with that girl in the club last night. Check her mobile call history for numbers that have no names. Maybe even ring the number, and you never know it might be answered by someone saying hello sweetheart/gorgeous etc.

Only someone who is very close to your girlfriend would do this and it would certainly have their name next to the number. If she insists on going out with her girlfriends tell her you will meet her somewhere later on. See if she then has a change of plan, or texts(likely) or phones(unlikely) to say they have all gone somewhere else as it was quiet.

When you see her next time she will say she had no signal to let you know they had a late change of plans. Do not tell your mates you think she is cheating as it could be them who she is cheating with. It is very easy to catch a cheat, but you will know if she is cheating because your instincts and your heart will tell you."
1,"Easy, you will tell. Her eyes will be burning a different stare. If she doesn't act differently at all, but you still have the inkling (or if she has a history), then she is probably a much more experienced cheater.

Cocky, dramatic and beautiful girls are much more likely to cheat, most likely with your friends if they are reasonably close. If you think she is cheating, she probably is and if she isn't and you think she is, then you probably shouldn't be with her anyway.

Tell her you want to spend some time away from her for a week or two (detach yourself from her because you're probably being paranoid needy and pushing her away), then don't talk for a couple of days. 

Remember women cheat mostly for emotional reasons and they will rationalise it and say that was out of their control, thus shedding responsibility. If she seems cold she is probably blaming you for her guilt (as she is controlled by her emotions).

Everyone is capable of cheating (Its hard-wired into us), the best thing you can do is to keep one step back from a girl at all times and only reward good behaviour with attention. If you feel she is cheating, then don't do all those good things you have been doing for her. Her rationale if she were cheating on you would be: ""If you make me feel as though I am cheating, then it's almost as bad as if I was"".

Remember there are some amazing girls out there who are much more mature and stable, however you will find a lot of gorgeous girls have a lot of personal problems because they have never had to grow up or be responsible for their actions.

If you have one of these girls, don't try to see the inner beauty - have fun physically, instead. They will cause you enormous heartache. Find yourself a different girl, in fact find yourself a number of girlfriends (don't just stick to one girlfriend because it guarantees you sex that is disrespectful to her and to yourself).

Anyway don't worry to much about it, If she is cheating, don't give her the joy of the chase, ignore her burn all that lovey stuff you had together (they were only props in her fantasy anyway, while she had the romance with you, she took the penis from others like a true champ). Find somebody new and don't make the same mistake. Peace out."
1,"There's always ways to find out. Try to get close to her best friend, one of her best friends might rat on her friend because they see what a great guy you are.

Also if she always calls you or texts you every morning saying something sweet, and all of a sudden she stops texting you, then something is up.

Facebook is always a good way to catch a cheater, try making a fake page and make friends with her. Start talking to her, little by little, start liking her statuses, and make her talk to you. That's how I found one of my ex girlfriends - she flirted with me on my fake page, and I never told her. I kept it this way for a while.

She gave me her number saying she was single and that she likes to drink and party that we should meet up one day, but I always said I couldn't. I used a text free number to text her I would text her from my iPod when I was in the restroom, saying ""hi how are you sweetheart?"" or ""are you busy, can we talk?"". When I walked back in the room, I would ask her who just texted her, and she would say it was her best friend.

There was one time when she told me she was having problems with a man and needed me to go pick her up that got me mad, but didn't show it. She got in the shower, and I got one of my friends to call her back and ask her if she wanted to meet up. She agreed.

When she got out of the shower I asked her if she was going to meet a friend and she said ""yeah, I'll be back soon"" so I told her I'd come with her, and then she started saying ""no, she needs me, she don't want you to see her like this, blah blah blah...""

Well guess what? I was the guy she was meeting up with! My friend picked me up and we went to meet her. I texted her, and told her I was in the black car. When she started walking to the car I rolled the window down, and the look on her face was priceless!

Sorry for posting my story, but if in your heart you feel that she's cheating, then you should follow those feelings."
1,"In order to know if your girlfriend is cheating on you, you should just wait and watch the entire situation unfold. You see, if you over-react to the whole thing, she might prove that she is not cheating on you. If your love is true, and your feelings towards her are loyal, than she will for sure feel guilty, and she will come up to you and admit her mistake. So just wait for the right time.

If you want her to admit her mistake, and tell you the truth, then you should show her how much you love her. Show her what she means to you, and what her existence means to you. Tell her that her love has shown you the new part of life.

After knowing all this she will feel bad and guilty for cheating on you, and being disloyal. But then again what you're considering might only your imagination or assumptions. You see at times, we do feel scared of losing someone we love so much, and that's why such concerns enter our minds once in a while. So just have faith in yourself and your love."
1,"She will often avoid your eyes, and whenever you try to make plans, she will awkwardly struggle for an excuse. If she is known to be a good liar, well, just pull her to the side and ask her if anything is wrong. Just be honest."
1,"Okay, its easy I have an example: When you're done making love to your girlfriend, and you're still in  bed, hugging and kissing, say ""I know"", or ""I know what happened"", or ""I know what you did"" - something like that.

For me, it was only ""I know"" - and remember, do not mention anything about cheating. Once you've said that, if she answers with: ""I didnt cheat on you"", it's 100% certain that she did, because you didnt even mention anything about cheating. Once she says that, you say: ""I didnt even say anything like that"". If she gets mad in any way, then she cheated - simple is that."
1,"It is always difficult to peep into somebody's heart and know their actual feelings and desires as well as his or her attitude. Though this task is very difficult, some people are wise enough to judge and note the feelings and desires of others. Once you develop relationships, especially with girls, you should be sensible enough to note her actual feelings and demands.

Usually girls are experts at hiding their actual feelings and desires. If you want to discover whether your girlfriend is cheating on you or not, you will have to use some measures and methods. Test her on different occasions without her notice and if she does not prove worthy, that means she is not sincere to you.

Give her chances to deal with other boys freely, and notice her movements. If she is not bothered about other boys, that means she is sincere to you. If, on the other hand, she takes more interest in other boys, that means she is cheating on you."
1,"One of the first things is that you will feel it in your heart. It is a nagging sensation that finally makes you start to notice things. Maybe, as a couple you were initially very relaxed together, and suddenly you don't feel so laid back around her. Perhaps she starts pulling away a little at a time, or she isn't acting as sweet as before?

Believe me, you will know if she is cheating on you: Remember the eyes are the mirror to your soul, even the best liar can't stop the eyes from showing the truth."
1,The most obvious thing that you can spot is that she is really nervous around you!
1,"Women that lie will cheat, I can't stand that. If my girl ever cheats on me, I'll just toss her out and check in with the next girl on my list. If they cheat, oh well - they'll never see me again, either."
1,She becomes distant and quickly gets attitude. She doesn't let you see her phone and will find any excuse to get mad. I'm just saying from experience. I'm sorry MJ.
1,"Well I have done it before, it's quite simple actually. She will carry her phone about with her day and night, she wont leave it lying around where you can get it.

If you are sitting watching TV, she will  keep asking whether you are all right? Then she get all nervous, and lost for words, but trust me, in the end she will always feel guilty."
1,You can tell if she hasn't been spending much time with you and doesn't want to answer your calls.
1,"Well I believe my girl is doing just that. She will erase texts and calls from her phone. She said she did it because she was bored. A lot of times she does not answer my calls, and comes up with dumb excuses. 

We have been together three years and only three times have I 'hit the back'.  Now out of nowhere she likes it there.  I think she has been with someone else, and just feels bad because she let someone else hit that, and that whenever I asked her, she would just call me names.  Now that's all she wants.

She would cook lunch for me everyday.  We work at same company as drivers, we would meet there for lunch. Now she is always running late. Too bad its her conscience. She will carry that for life."
1,"She sounds like a complete head-case dude! If your relationship faces a problem, but at the first chance she runs into another guys' arms, then it can't be very good.

Sit her down and tell her your fears, and ask her if she really thinks your relationship is worth carrying on. I know how much it hurts, but if she isn't 100% into you, she doesn't deserve the relationship and it's better for you in the long run to break up with her."
1,"If she seems like she is hanging out with other guys, then she might be cheating on you. Ask her if she wants to go out. If she stumbles or says no, or even just sounds unsure, take that as a sign. Ask her if she still wants to be with you."
1,"If she avoids you, and starts to flirt with guys."
1,"Well, there are a few things. For one, don't forget the song lyrics ""Believe half of what you see and none of what you hear"". That's a good thing to remember. There will be little things a cheater will do, like lying. You don't want a liar. You definitely don't want a cheater.

If you feel there is reason to wonder, then you need to talk to your lady and find out if you are right or not. If you can't get anywhere that way, you can ask other people who know her. I do not suggest you set her up to test her, although sometimes that is the only way.

In today's world it is very important to be safe, and random flings with cheating people can have you at the clinic getting a prescription for something, or worse. Not to mention the morals you would want to be present in the mother of any children you have. Be picky - do not settle."
1,"Oh that's a tough one, with me being a girl it's hard for me to answer this question, but if you have doubts just confront her and say something like: ""I want to be the only guy for you, I can't share you, I want to know, is there someone else?"".

If there is, then tough luck kid, sorry. If that doesn't work, talk to her friends and tell them how you feel. (If you do break up with her because she's shady tell her as much, but don't be to mean about it, no one likes to be talked at!).

- Erica"
1,Become real cool friends with her friends. Don't go to far with it. Some of her friends who know if she's not doing right will feel bad for you if she is. You might find the truth. Sometimes even more comes from it. I did it once. What goes around comes around.
1,"So, recently my girlfriend started talking to a guy on Facebook. One night whilst watching a movie with her she goes onto my laptop to check her Facebook and sits there for ages using the 'chat' feature on it.

I noticed that she's talking to the guy in question so I asked her who she's talking to - the answer was that it was a mutual friend of ours. So I left it. I checked again, and as soon as I turned my head she closes the page. So I pretended to stretch and watch TV and then noticed she reopened the chat with the guy.

I confronted her about it and asked why she lied. She got nervous and said she wasn't lying to me (she wasn't technically lying, but she did withhold the information when I asked). Eventually she told me he was being inappropriate to her, that she didn't want me getting jealous or annoyed about it, and that she was telling him to get lost.

A couple of nights later, my iPod starts bleeping, so I check it and find she had been using the Facebook app on it, and was still logged in. From what I read I saw that she had traded numbers with a guy and was texting and ringing him and talking on MSN.

Now from past experience I go by gut feeling, I'm not a jealous guy because my girlfriend has many male friends that I'm fine with. But for my girlfriend to suddenly start talking to someone and get his number a couple of days later when shes never even met the guy before is a little odd to me.

I confronted her about it and told her how I'd found out. She told me nothing was going on, she also said 'me and him get on well'. She added that she felt lonely (most of her close friends have moved away recently and she doesnt get to talk to them much). So I understood that, but she had still kept talking to the guy even after telling me he was being inappropriate to her.

Recently I've noticed her being online quite late at night, when in the past she hasnt been (she's logged in on MSN, and has also been on after telling me over the phone that she was going to bed a couple of hours previously).

So far all this, plus my gut feeling is telling me she's hiding something. I also checked her phone a few minutes ago and she has deleted all her messages, inbox and sent messages.

She hasn't changed her attitude towards me much. But I know her and she's a smart girl, she could hide behind a false mask if she felt the need to.

Any help on this would be appreciated, am I being paranoid? Should I wait and see if anything else turns up?"
0,"To be honest with everyone on here, I trust my girlfriend completely. When we first started dating it was perfect. Cute lovely phrases, lots of touching and she called and wrote to me constantly.

Here we are two years down the road and she rarely answers my calls, saying she left her phone in the other room, or her battery died. She's not straight-forward with me any more.  I came home to find her in bed with my brother last week.

Of course I was expecting it, her tell tale signs are: Stuttering when asked a question about other guys; lack of closeness; distant; and she stopped being straight-forward with me.

Basic knowledge about your girl will help you spot any problems. Pay attention to her emotional attachment, her intimacy towards you, and her personality at the beginning of your relationship. Personality changes when someone has something to hide.

I'm an eye person, I look into eyes and examine them. If your girl often looked into your eyes  when you first started dating, and now looks away, you know something is wrong. Doesn't necessarily mean she's cheating.

How they react is the best way. The things you did in the beginning that drove her crazy, end up not working on her any more, it usually means something else was done to her that she liked better. Best of luck to all of you, hope it helps - hope you don't end up like me.

1,"If she stops calling you for a long period of time, and how she is in school (if she acts weird, or not the same as before), I am sorry but she might be cheating.

If you are in different schools, you can always pop out of no-where or decide to meet her after school and see for yourself. Sorry if my answer is no help to you."
1,By her jealous face and lips because she probably kissed that other guy.
1,"Some of the signs to help you tell is if she has been acting detached lately, doesn't say that cute stuff to you any more, and if she has been trying to avoid you."
1,"Well this might sound quite sneaky, but check her cell phone - they usually have conversations with the guy if they are cheating."
1,"I would not rely on the so-called 'tell-tale' signs, because the only way to really know is to catch them in the act. However, even just a suspicion of cheating means that there isn't full trust in the relationship (or that there are other unresolved issues), and this is probably a bigger problem (since it is the cause of these issues), than if she was really cheating on you."
1,"You can tell if a girl is cheating on you because she will become very distant. She will ignore your phone calls and say she is spending time with her pals, who you have never heard off. One thing I have learnt is to just get over the fact she is cheating, but if you love her, give it another go,

Make sure the other bloke knows his place! But, if you can't get over it then split up with her or else you will go crazy. But most of you blokes will just think there is something going on as she is a lot better looking than you are or she has had a lot of other blokes in the past.

But never doubt your partner without reason as you will drive her away. I have a saying which goes: "" Don't accuse unless you have proof"".

I hope this helps."

1,"Sigh... I'm a girl and I'm online right now looking for solutions to something last night that I shouldn't have done. The whole cheating thing where she doesn't answer your calls and blah blah doesn't always apply.

For me, I did something terrible last night that went against my own rules while I was drunk and here I am going crazy over it. I want to see my boyfriend and I am scared to tell him. I don't know if I should.

We're in a long-distance three-year relationship, and he's the best thing that's ever happened to me. Why did I cheat on him last night? Because there was a physical attraction between me and a guy here at college that has been producing sexual tension ever since I met him.

It was great when it happened but I would not ever give up what I have with my boyfriend for it. It was stupid of me and I hate myself right now. I let myself down, and my boyfriend and I desperately want to see him again.

What our interaction will be at that point, I'm not sure. We trust each other 100%. I know he would never cheat on me and he knows I would never cheat on him. I knew I never would cheat on him. And here I am hating myself.

The point is, if someone cheats, guy or girl, it depends on your relationship with them. If you are suspicious and want to know how you can tell if she's cheating, then already there is something wrong. But if she's acting funny and you know she would never do this to you - it's a possibility that it's eating her alive inside. So, look at your relationship with her and see whether it's worth it or not."
1,Use the grape vine my brother!

1,Try changing brands of shampoo and conditioner. Certain ones just don't work for my hair. Also (for me) it can depend on the time of year. Like right now (the start of winter) my hair is so dry. Even though it's the same shampoo and conditioner I use for summer.
1,"I have a seemingly counterintuitive suggestion: Of course if you’re not shampooing regularly already, you should shampoo more often.
However, if you ARE shampooing regularly, and it’s not working, I would suggest trying to CUT DOWN on shampooing. Shampooing strips hair of natural oils, and your scalp may produce more and more as a result.
Search up “no -poo”, there communities of people doing this and it works for them. Might not work for everyone.
Also, use dry shampoo!!! Basically it’s alcohol and powder in a aerosol can. Spray it in your hair, wait 3 minutes, then comb it all out. It rids all the oil and germs. There’s even dark dry shampoo for dark hair! (Lol I discovered it just this month and it’s really improved my hair situation.) If it works good on my long hair, I can imagine it’ll work even better for shorter hair.
If your hair gets too dry, take a tiny bit of coconut oil and comb that over the ends of your hair (not the scalp). Wash every other day, or if you sweat/get dirty. Otherwise, shower but put on a shower cap (or a walmart bag like i do...it’s very loud though)."

1,"When you first start thinking a girl is cheating on you then there is obviously something wrong with your relationship and you will notice little things, like she does not answer your calls all the time. She will say she was in the bath/shower, or left it in other room, or the phone will be turned off and she will say the battery was flat.

Has she got a load of new friends that you have never heard of before or just one friend who she has not mentioned to you? When you query her she will say that she has told you about her, so then it starts putting doubts in your head and then you start to imagine it is you with the problem.

She starts to argue with you for no reason, and then storms out, accusing you of always starting arguments. Has she taken a bit more care of herself when going out, for example: Spending more time doing her hair, wearing best clothes when she is out with the girls, showing a bit more cleavage or a bit more leg?

Never let a girl who you are in a relationship with go to a nightclub without you, there is a reason she does not want you there. Lads are bad when they are out, but believe me girls are twenty times worse.

It is very easy for girls to get noticed and even if they are not the prettiest there is always some lad in any town who will want to brag about going with that girl in the club last night. Check her mobile call history for numbers that have no names. Maybe even ring the number, and you never know it might be answered by someone saying hello sweetheart/gorgeous etc.

Only someone who is very close to your girlfriend would do this and it would certainly have their name next to the number. If she insists on going out with her girlfriends tell her you will meet her somewhere later on. See if she then has a change of plan, or texts(likely) or phones(unlikely) to say they have all gone somewhere else as it was quiet.

When you see her next time she will say she had no signal to let you know they had a late change of plans. Do not tell your mates you think she is cheating as it could be them who she is cheating with. It is very easy to catch a cheat, but you will know if she is cheating because your instincts and your heart will tell you."
1,"Easy, you will tell. Her eyes will be burning a different stare. If she doesn't act differently at all, but you still have the inkling (or if she has a history), then she is probably a much more experienced cheater.

Cocky, dramatic and beautiful girls are much more likely to cheat, most likely with your friends if they are reasonably close. If you think she is cheating, she probably is and if she isn't and you think she is, then you probably shouldn't be with her anyway.

Tell her you want to spend some time away from her for a week or two (detach yourself from her because you're probably being paranoid needy and pushing her away), then don't talk for a couple of days. 

Remember women cheat mostly for emotional reasons and they will rationalise it and say that was out of their control, thus shedding responsibility. If she seems cold she is probably blaming you for her guilt (as she is controlled by her emotions).

Everyone is capable of cheating (Its hard-wired into us), the best thing you can do is to keep one step back from a girl at all times and only reward good behaviour with attention. If you feel she is cheating, then don't do all those good things you have been doing for her. Her rationale if she were cheating on you would be: ""If you make me feel as though I am cheating, then it's almost as bad as if I was"".

Remember there are some amazing girls out there who are much more mature and stable, however you will find a lot of gorgeous girls have a lot of personal problems because they have never had to grow up or be responsible for their actions.

If you have one of these girls, don't try to see the inner beauty - have fun physically, instead. They will cause you enormous heartache. Find yourself a different girl, in fact find yourself a number of girlfriends (don't just stick to one girlfriend because it guarantees you sex that is disrespectful to her and to yourself).

Anyway don't worry to much about it, If she is cheating, don't give her the joy of the chase, ignore her burn all that lovey stuff you had together (they were only props in her fantasy anyway, while she had the romance with you, she took the penis from others like a true champ). Find somebody new and don't make the same mistake. Peace out."
1,"There's always ways to find out. Try to get close to her best friend, one of her best friends might rat on her friend because they see what a great guy you are.

Also if she always calls you or texts you every morning saying something sweet, and all of a sudden she stops texting you, then something is up.

Facebook is always a good way to catch a cheater, try making a fake page and make friends with her. Start talking to her, little by little, start liking her statuses, and make her talk to you. That's how I found one of my ex girlfriends - she flirted with me on my fake page, and I never told her. I kept it this way for a while.

She gave me her number saying she was single and that she likes to drink and party that we should meet up one day, but I always said I couldn't. I used a text free number to text her I would text her from my iPod when I was in the restroom, saying ""hi how are you sweetheart?"" or ""are you busy, can we talk?"". When I walked back in the room, I would ask her who just texted her, and she would say it was her best friend.

There was one time when she told me she was having problems with a man and needed me to go pick her up that got me mad, but didn't show it. She got in the shower, and I got one of my friends to call her back and ask her if she wanted to meet up. She agreed.

When she got out of the shower I asked her if she was going to meet a friend and she said ""yeah, I'll be back soon"" so I told her I'd come with her, and then she started saying ""no, she needs me, she don't want you to see her like this, blah blah blah...""

Well guess what? I was the guy she was meeting up with! My friend picked me up and we went to meet her. I texted her, and told her I was in the black car. When she started walking to the car I rolled the window down, and the look on her face was priceless!

Sorry for posting my story, but if in your heart you feel that she's cheating, then you should follow those feelings."
1,"In order to know if your girlfriend is cheating on you, you should just wait and watch the entire situation unfold. You see, if you over-react to the whole thing, she might prove that she is not cheating on you. If your love is true, and your feelings towards her are loyal, than she will for sure feel guilty, and she will come up to you and admit her mistake. So just wait for the right time.

If you want her to admit her mistake, and tell you the truth, then you should show her how much you love her. Show her what she means to you, and what her existence means to you. Tell her that her love has shown you the new part of life.

After knowing all this she will feel bad and guilty for cheating on you, and being disloyal. But then again what you're considering might only your imagination or assumptions. You see at times, we do feel scared of losing someone we love so much, and that's why such concerns enter our minds once in a while. So just have faith in yourself and your love."
1,"She will often avoid your eyes, and whenever you try to make plans, she will awkwardly struggle for an excuse. If she is known to be a good liar, well, just pull her to the side and ask her if anything is wrong. Just be honest."
1,"Okay, its easy I have an example: When you're done making love to your girlfriend, and you're still in  bed, hugging and kissing, say ""I know"", or ""I know what happened"", or ""I know what you did"" - something like that.

For me, it was only ""I know"" - and remember, do not mention anything about cheating. Once you've said that, if she answers with: ""I didnt cheat on you"", it's 100% certain that she did, because you didnt even mention anything about cheating. Once she says that, you say: ""I didnt even say anything like that"". If she gets mad in any way, then she cheated - simple is that."
1,"It is always difficult to peep into somebody's heart and know their actual feelings and desires as well as his or her attitude. Though this task is very difficult, some people are wise enough to judge and note the feelings and desires of others. Once you develop relationships, especially with girls, you should be sensible enough to note her actual feelings and demands.

Usually girls are experts at hiding their actual feelings and desires. If you want to discover whether your girlfriend is cheating on you or not, you will have to use some measures and methods. Test her on different occasions without her notice and if she does not prove worthy, that means she is not sincere to you.

Give her chances to deal with other boys freely, and notice her movements. If she is not bothered about other boys, that means she is sincere to you. If, on the other hand, she takes more interest in other boys, that means she is cheating on you."
1,"One of the first things is that you will feel it in your heart. It is a nagging sensation that finally makes you start to notice things. Maybe, as a couple you were initially very relaxed together, and suddenly you don't feel so laid back around her. Perhaps she starts pulling away a little at a time, or she isn't acting as sweet as before?

Believe me, you will know if she is cheating on you: Remember the eyes are the mirror to your soul, even the best liar can't stop the eyes from showing the truth."
1,The most obvious thing that you can spot is that she is really nervous around you!
1,"Women that lie will cheat, I can't stand that. If my girl ever cheats on me, I'll just toss her out and check in with the next girl on my list. If they cheat, oh well - they'll never see me again, either."
1,She becomes distant and quickly gets attitude. She doesn't let you see her phone and will find any excuse to get mad. I'm just saying from experience. I'm sorry MJ.
1,"Well I have done it before, it's quite simple actually. She will carry her phone about with her day and night, she wont leave it lying around where you can get it.

If you are sitting watching TV, she will  keep asking whether you are all right? Then she get all nervous, and lost for words, but trust me, in the end she will always feel guilty."
1,You can tell if she hasn't been spending much time with you and doesn't want to answer your calls.
1,"Well I believe my girl is doing just that. She will erase texts and calls from her phone. She said she did it because she was bored. A lot of times she does not answer my calls, and comes up with dumb excuses. 

We have been together three years and only three times have I 'hit the back'.  Now out of nowhere she likes it there.  I think she has been with someone else, and just feels bad because she let someone else hit that, and that whenever I asked her, she would just call me names.  Now that's all she wants.

She would cook lunch for me everyday.  We work at same company as drivers, we would meet there for lunch. Now she is always running late. Too bad its her conscience. She will carry that for life."
1,"She sounds like a complete head-case dude! If your relationship faces a problem, but at the first chance she runs into another guys' arms, then it can't be very good.

Sit her down and tell her your fears, and ask her if she really thinks your relationship is worth carrying on. I know how much it hurts, but if she isn't 100% into you, she doesn't deserve the relationship and it's better for you in the long run to break up with her."
1,"If she seems like she is hanging out with other guys, then she might be cheating on you. Ask her if she wants to go out. If she stumbles or says no, or even just sounds unsure, take that as a sign. Ask her if she still wants to be with you."
1,"If she avoids you, and starts to flirt with guys."
1,"Well, there are a few things. For one, don't forget the song lyrics ""Believe half of what you see and none of what you hear"". That's a good thing to remember. There will be little things a cheater will do, like lying. You don't want a liar. You definitely don't want a cheater.

If you feel there is reason to wonder, then you need to talk to your lady and find out if you are right or not. If you can't get anywhere that way, you can ask other people who know her. I do not suggest you set her up to test her, although sometimes that is the only way.

In today's world it is very important to be safe, and random flings with cheating people can have you at the clinic getting a prescription for something, or worse. Not to mention the morals you would want to be present in the mother of any children you have. Be picky - do not settle."
1,"Oh that's a tough one, with me being a girl it's hard for me to answer this question, but if you have doubts just confront her and say something like: ""I want to be the only guy for you, I can't share you, I want to know, is there someone else?"".

If there is, then tough luck kid, sorry. If that doesn't work, talk to her friends and tell them how you feel. (If you do break up with her because she's shady tell her as much, but don't be to mean about it, no one likes to be talked at!).

- Erica"
1,Become real cool friends with her friends. Don't go to far with it. Some of her friends who know if she's not doing right will feel bad for you if she is. You might find the truth. Sometimes even more comes from it. I did it once. What goes around comes around.
1,"So, recently my girlfriend started talking to a guy on Facebook. One night whilst watching a movie with her she goes onto my laptop to check her Facebook and sits there for ages using the 'chat' feature on it.

I noticed that she's talking to the guy in question so I asked her who she's talking to - the answer was that it was a mutual friend of ours. So I left it. I checked again, and as soon as I turned my head she closes the page. So I pretended to stretch and watch TV and then noticed she reopened the chat with the guy.

I confronted her about it and asked why she lied. She got nervous and said she wasn't lying to me (she wasn't technically lying, but she did withhold the information when I asked). Eventually she told me he was being inappropriate to her, that she didn't want me getting jealous or annoyed about it, and that she was telling him to get lost.

A couple of nights later, my iPod starts bleeping, so I check it and find she had been using the Facebook app on it, and was still logged in. From what I read I saw that she had traded numbers with a guy and was texting and ringing him and talking on MSN.

Now from past experience I go by gut feeling, I'm not a jealous guy because my girlfriend has many male friends that I'm fine with. But for my girlfriend to suddenly start talking to someone and get his number a couple of days later when shes never even met the guy before is a little odd to me.

I confronted her about it and told her how I'd found out. She told me nothing was going on, she also said 'me and him get on well'. She added that she felt lonely (most of her close friends have moved away recently and she doesnt get to talk to them much). So I understood that, but she had still kept talking to the guy even after telling me he was being inappropriate to her.

Recently I've noticed her being online quite late at night, when in the past she hasnt been (she's logged in on MSN, and has also been on after telling me over the phone that she was going to bed a couple of hours previously).

So far all this, plus my gut feeling is telling me she's hiding something. I also checked her phone a few minutes ago and she has deleted all her messages, inbox and sent messages.

She hasn't changed her attitude towards me much. But I know her and she's a smart girl, she could hide behind a false mask if she felt the need to.

Any help on this would be appreciated, am I being paranoid? Should I wait and see if anything else turns up?"
0,"To be honest with everyone on here, I trust my girlfriend completely. When we first started dating it was perfect. Cute lovely phrases, lots of touching and she called and wrote to me constantly.

Here we are two years down the road and she rarely answers my calls, saying she left her phone in the other room, or her battery died. She's not straight-forward with me any more.  I came home to find her in bed with my brother last week.

Of course I was expecting it, her tell tale signs are: Stuttering when asked a question about other guys; lack of closeness; distant; and she stopped being straight-forward with me.

Basic knowledge about your girl will help you spot any problems. Pay attention to her emotional attachment, her intimacy towards you, and her personality at the beginning of your relationship. Personality changes when someone has something to hide.

I'm an eye person, I look into eyes and examine them. If your girl often looked into your eyes  when you first started dating, and now looks away, you know something is wrong. Doesn't necessarily mean she's cheating.

How they react is the best way. The things you did in the beginning that drove her crazy, end up not working on her any more, it usually means something else was done to her that she liked better. Best of luck to all of you, hope it helps - hope you don't end up like me.

  ~puddin~"
1,"If she stops calling you for a long period of time, and how she is in school (if she acts weird, or not the same as before), I am sorry but she might be cheating.

If you are in different schools, you can always pop out of no-where or decide to meet her after school and see for yourself. Sorry if my answer is no help to you."
1,By her jealous face and lips because she probably kissed that other guy.
1,"Some of the signs to help you tell is if she has been acting detached lately, doesn't say that cute stuff to you any more, and if she has been trying to avoid you."
1,"Well this might sound quite sneaky, but check her cell phone - they usually have conversations with the guy if they are cheating."
1,"I would not rely on the so-called 'tell-tale' signs, because the only way to really know is to catch them in the act. However, even just a suspicion of cheating means that there isn't full trust in the relationship (or that there are other unresolved issues), and this is probably a bigger problem (since it is the cause of these issues), than if she was really cheating on you."
1,"You can tell if a girl is cheating on you because she will become very distant. She will ignore your phone calls and say she is spending time with her pals, who you have never heard off. One thing I have learnt is to just get over the fact she is cheating, but if you love her, give it another go,

Make sure the other bloke knows his place! But, if you can't get over it then split up with her or else you will go crazy. But most of you blokes will just think there is something going on as she is a lot better looking than you are or she has had a lot of other blokes in the past.

But never doubt your partner without reason as you will drive her away. I have a saying which goes: "" Don't accuse unless you have proof"".

I hope this helps."

1,"No, you should not tell her.  It is there business.  I know its tough and you want to but it is not your business to tell her.  Guys and girls both cheat sometimes it is sad and awful but that is life.  She will probably eventually find out some other way.  Your brother is your family and you don't want to start problems.  Maybe if you still feel like telling her have her find out some other way that don't involve you or your friends or family and that it don't come back on.  Good luck and take care."
1,"That's a difficult question...it depends n what you are willing to deal with personally. What your brother is doing is terrible, but horribly commonplace. Should she know? Absolutely. The question is, are you willing to damage your relationship with your brother? Depending on how old he is, he will likely get over the 'betrayal' of you telling his girlfriend the truth, but in the meantime, his motto would be to keep out! Did you personally witness cheating, did he tell you, or did you suspect it? If you personally witnessed it and you feel she might be in some danger (STD's, etc.), perhaps try to remind your brother of the very selfish danger he's putting her in. I know it's hard, but remind him how angry and hurt he would feel if she betrayed him. It is up to you whether or not to confront him or her, but you have many options. Could you tell a parent and have them talk to him (without him knowing it was you)? It's true, it's their business, but the people being hurt rarely like to be the laughing stock as everyone stands around them and wonders..."

Anytime you cheat on somebody that dsz.... Will never go. Why? You have planted a seed and all it needs is your thought"
1,Don't get involved that will just create drama! Your brother will just get mad at you and that will start a whoe other problem. YOUR not the one who is at fault so YOU shouldn't have to clean up after your brother. However you should try to convince your brother to tell his girlfriend the truth. Hope this helps. Good Luck!

1,"Growing your own weed can be a rocky road but if you have the time and the patience for it, then you will need to take into account several aspects:
1 – Choose your seeds well. From relaxing to energizing, from creativity inducing to cancer pain relieving there is no shortage of the types of seeds one can choose
from.  Choose yours accordingly to what you are trying to achieve.
2 – Find somewhere appropriate with enough light. Whether outdoors or indoors your seeds will need, at the very least, 6 hours of continuous light exposure (natural or artificial).
3 – Germinate your seeds before planting them. You can do this by popping them in a cup of warm water and leave them in a dark place from 1 to 3 days (until you see a sprout).
4 – Plant the germinated seed in unfertilized soil by digging a not
very deep hole and covering it up. Keep the soil moist at all times.
5 – Provide fresh moving air in the surrounding area. You can do this
with a simple fan.
6 - Transfer the sprout to fertilized soil (as the stronger seed won't
be harmed by it anymore).
7 – Make sure the temperature around the plant is constantly around
the 67 degrees (Fahrenheit) mark.
8 – Watch it grow from 8 to 16 weeks. Your plant should be ready to be harvested when most of the “hairs” on it turn from white to red.
9- Enjoy!
Of course, it goes without saying that marijuana must be legal to grow in your state/country, otherwise none of the above is advisable!"
1,"It should be noted that it's illegal to grown marijuana in many places around the world.  For that reason, the following information is for educational purposes only, and should not be used unless it's legal for you to do so wherever you are.
Here are the basic principles of growing your own weed.
First and foremost you'll need to obtain some seeds.  There are a variety of websites offering these products, but I won't list them here.  A simple Google search will provide you with plenty of options.
You'll need to decide where you'll grow your marijuana.  If indoors, you'll need somewhere like a closet or spare bathroom.
The next step is to choose your light.  This is really important, and there are loads of options, including LED grow lights, fluorescent bulbs, and sodium bulbs.
Now you'll need to decide on what soul you'll use.  Organic compost is usually the best choice here.
It's likely that you'll need some soil nutrients unless you're using a high grade compost.  One of the most common choices is Dyna-Gro.
You should now invest in a product such as Rapid Rooter that allows you to germinate your seeds prior to planting them in your high grade soil.  What you need to do is place your seeds into the Rapid Rooters and keep them moist for a fee days until they being to sprout.
You'll want to grow your plants in a warm environment.  The usual recommendations are 70-85F (20-30C).  Your light should remain on the plants for 24 hours per day if possible.
When your cannabis plants start to grow buds, it's time to check for any male plants (the ones with pollen sacs and not white hairs).  Discard the male plants as they do not grow buds.
Now you need to reduce the amount of light your plants get per day to 12 hours on, 12 ours off. 
Your plants will continue to grow until they're ready to harvest.
So there you have it - a very basic guide to growing your own weed.  Please do remember that it's illegal to do this is many areas of the world, and there are severe consequences for those who break the law in this regard."

1,"Yeah, we all encounter a few along the way ... The ones who never learn to be grateful for their blessings."
1,"A dermatologist friend recommended:

1. Wash with a salicylic acid wash

2. Apply a glycolic acid cream(Alpha Hydroxy) to the entire face and other problem areas

3. Finally use 10% benzoyl peroxide directly on breakouts.

Do daily.

All available at walgreens for a few bucks."
1,I have heard good things about this product. But I'm not a specialist in acne treatment. You should talk to a doctor first before using it. Hope this helps.        Www.proactiv.com/index.php?acnt=GHP00000&s_kwcid=acne%20treatment|2161866378
,"Hi,
I used Top Shirley Medicated Cream and it really worked for me.  After years of spending money on a countless number of products which promised to work, I finally found one which actually did what it said.

I use it twice a day, morning and night.  Shirley Medicated Cream has really cleared my skin up, I no longer break out, and best of all it has faded my acne scars.  I would thoroughly recommend this to any one with serious skin problems.

I brought mine from www.shirleycream.co.uk.  Give it a go.  I hope it helps."
1,"While some skin problems are fixable through home remedies and simple hacks, for more serious problems such as acne or pigmentation, you need more than that. Acne is a deep rooted problem that requires a high-performance skincare solution, such as Melblok Home Kit Advanced. Bundling dedicated products for day and night, the kit is the only product you will ever need to keep hyperpigmentation at bay."
1,I'm currently using top shirely medicated cream I have a friend who tried it and the effects were unbelievable.. I heard some really good things about it .. Its very cheap and you can find it in beauty stores
1,"In some cases, you can reduce melanin and increase the whiteness in your face by using special creams with active ingredients known as mercurous chloride and/or hydroquinone. These chemical agents remove pigment from the skin; however, they don't work immediately. A regular course of treatment with such lotions or ointments will be needed, and results may vary based on each person's original skin tone, as well as other variables.

Stars such as the late Michael Jackson were rumored to use such creams to excess - in Jackson's case, if he did use lightening creams to alter the tone of his complexion, he spoiled a lovely, dark skin tone, turning it almost bone-white over time. It can be tempting to use such creams to exact a radical change - however, you can be almost certain that your natural skin tone is really the best choice for you. Dark skin is beautiful and hides flaws more easily than pale, porcelain skin does. There can be many benefits to staying darker. Melanin also protects the skin (to an extent) from sun damage and other health problems related to the skin; the skin is our body's biggest organ, so you must be careful how you treat it. If you choose to use skin lighteners for whiter skin, be certain you do so under a dermatologist's care. At the least, make sure the products you choose (such as hydroquinone creams) are highly rated and produced by trusted manufacturers. Don't take chances with your complexion, as reversing skin lightening can be difficult, and results may not always be even or exactly what you envisioned before you started treatment.

Skin-lightening creams are available from dermatologists, and in drugstores and chain stores. The amounts of active ingredients in each product will vary; products prescribed by a doctor will generally have a higher concentration of active ingredients - products sold over the counter will have lower amounts of active ingredients, so they are safer for everyday use without a doctor's supervision."
1,"Excessive exposure to UV rays from the sun is one of the most common causes of melanin or hyperpigmentation. To lessen the damaging impact of UV rays on your skin, always apply an opaque sunblock screen containing zinc oxide or titanium oxide before stepping out in the sun.
You may use Melblok Advanced Day Cream, an anti-pigmentation moisturizing day cream for Pigmentation-prone skin."
1,"You cannot reduce the melanin in your face but you can wear sun protecting creams, keep out of the sun as much as possible."
0,"Better not to be a 'white ghost', and retain your natural beauty. Being white didn't do much for Wacko Jacko."
1,"Use hydroquinone, or kojic acid, stay out of sun, use sunbloack above 30 , use hat , shades , if going in sun."
1,"Stayed home and everyone came here.  We had a great day.
What did you do skip?"
1,Too much food to eat and watch tv football
1,Stayed home and cooked for the family.  It was a nice day.
1,We had our big shindig here on Christmas eve but my mother was sick and couldn't make it so we visited her Christmas day and gave her her gifts. One was a birthday gift for today.

1,I had a great Holiday but exhausting. Tried my hand at a Roast Christmas Goose. Came out great but a lot of work.
1,"This is a very valid question and there are some ways to influence your height:
You can change your posture and straighten your body.
You can stimulate your body in producing growth hormone.
You can make your spine longer.
Your genes will help you by reacting on your action.
If you are not an adult yet, you can increase the effects of each of these actions."
1,"There's nothing that you can do about your height. Growth hormone works varied & on it's own. It has nothing to do with relatives or anything else either. But still you can follow some factors to make sure you are trying & be hopeful that might helps you through your growing process.
1.Make sure enough protein, vitamin & calcium getting into your body. Just a good nutrition is crucial.
2.Get plenty of sleep. The ideal would be 8-10 hours.
3.Get plenty of water daily. Never let your body gets dehydrated.
4.Do stretches each morning right after you wake up & also during the day.
5.Follow & get valid yoga movements. Which that might help for growing as well.
6.Do pull ups.
7.Also products such as turnips, collard green, green beans & broccoli known as products that might impress the growth hormone.
-All i said above, they are not 100 % helpful. They are only a ""hope"" of doing something. Controlling our lifestyle & doing something is better than doing nothing. Plus, there has been several examples that those factors & some other as well, helped some people in some way.
-Tip: Hopefully you didn't lift heavy weight in your growing age, doing heavy weights on workout in growing age will stunt your growing process.
-Tip: All the human hormones will continue growing till the age of ""25"" that's where everything in a human will finish developing. Now usually people will finish growing on 18-20. But sometimes growing hormones will not finish in 17-18-20 age but it will continue along other hormones till 25.
-Tip: Mostly hormones grow very varied. You grow some height , you stop, then you will grow beard while most of people in your age has no beard, but you are shorter than most of the males in your age. Then you have beard but your voice is not developed fully but others have manly voices & taller but no beard! Then suddenly they stop growing but you just start growing suddenly & get taller than all of them! . . What i mean is the hormones get developed without any specific routine. So you have to check to have a healthy lifestyle & be patient with yourself.
Example: I know someone being 6.0 while he's been below 20. When he reached his 20, he grown height & reached 6.4 then in age of 24 turned 6.5."
1,most people stop growing at the age of 21 so just exercise a lot and eat healthy. I'm 6'2'' and the tallest person in my family by a long shot. I also have a long time until I'm done growing and I eat LOTS of broccoli so maybe that could help.
1,"Height increases up to the age of 18 in women and up to the age of 24 in men. Increase in height can be attributed to the production of a hormone, called the Human Growth Hormone, which is secreted by the pituitary gland within the human body.
How to Increase Height after the Age of 18 Years?
It is really difficult to increase height after the age of 18, primarily due to the fact that the bones stop growing at this age. Surgeries and growth hormones which promise height growth in adults are potentially dangerous and detrimental for the body. However, with a few tricks and tips, it is possible to add a few inches or at least appear taller.
I think Proper diet and nutrition play a vital role in improving your height.
Proper Diet and Nutrition:
In order to get protein, carbohydrates, amino acids and calcium required for healthy growth and development, attention should be paid on consuming the following food items.
.Carrots
.Egg yolk
.Beef
.Fish
.Liver
.Green vegetables
.Potatoes
.Nuts such as almonds and peanuts
.Chicken
.Beans
.Peas
.Fruits like apples and bananas
.Milk and dairy products
**Stretching and Exercise:
**yoga:
**proper sleep:"
1,"If I were you, I'd give up on this idea. Simply don't think about it, exercise and eat a lot of protein, keep my head up high and a straight posture, like mentioned above. Don't obsess over it, because in my observation, even if you grow an inch or two more, you'll never be quite satisfied if your goal is to become truly tall."
0,"You are probably not finished growing.
And Tom Cruise is 5' 7"""
,"Most guys finish growing in height around the age of 21. Eat a balanced diet, get a good amount of sleep and exercise, and your body will reach its maximum height. What exactly that height is we can't tell you. Genetics will play a huge factor there. In my family the guys are on average 5'10""-5'11"". There is the occasional one that makes it over 6'0"" or is only 5'6""-5'8""."
1,"Yes, I work with a couple whiners."
1,"I can't stand whiners. Thank goodness not around any anymore.

1,"I'm not a big eggnog fan, but to those who are, enjoy."
1,Eggnog is fine once a year. A seasonal drink to enjoy sparingly. It's liquid Christmas.
1,"Christmas has always been pagan and always will be. Many don't care, you can free food and clothes, bonus money, shopping aka sales and a legitimate way to get off work to visit your family and friends or just get off work, its about getting holiday pay or vacations and with merchants its about the mighty dollar. There're ones who enjoy the hoola and fun of all holidays!"
1,"Let's say they were ""Christianized"". Most of the practice of Christianity was born this way. You keep what you conquer.
It's harmless enough and secular observations of holidays are overtaking the pastoral aspect more and more each year. Santa is more prominent than Jesus in December."
1,"Simplest answer: Brainwashing.
Actually, there ARE some Christian sects that recognize the pagan roots of holidays and refuse to celebrate them.  In fact, it was only within the last century or so that Christmas became a major holiday when it became commercialized.
IMO, that's the problem with other religious holidays ... They HAVEN'T been commercialized.  If they were, the importance of them would be diluted - as would the importance of those religions - and then it wouldn't be so ""important"" that people kill each other for religions."
1,"The Christians (and probably other religious movements too) have always adapted ""things from the past"" for their own use. It is thought that the greater number of ancient churches in the UK are sited upon what had previously been earlier ""ritual sites"", and for the same reason. The places are usually easily seen from their immediate neighbourhood on the highest ground available.
The invention of Christianity around 2000 years ago (and heavily modified since) merely changed the ritual. The next ""big thing"" in terms of faith will probably re-purpose the sites again.
As to the re-purposing of holidays, why not? Just change the perceived deity and carry on."
1,"Christians don't do that,  I think what you are referring to is something that the bible says would be happening after the death of the apostles.  These scriptures explain it
2Tim 4: 3,4  - For there will be a period of time when they will not put up with the wholesome teaching, but according to their own desires, they will surround themselves with teachers to have their ears tickled. 4 They will turn away from listening to the truth and give attention to false stories.
Acts 20:30 - From among you yourselves men will rise and speak twisted things to draw away the disciples after themselves
2Pet 2:1,2 - There will also be false teachers among you. These very ones will quietly bring in destructive sects and will disown even the owner that bought them…..Also, with covetousness they will exploit you with counterfeit words."
1,"Well why would it matter, the entire religion has it's roots in what they call pagan religion. The OT is chock full of other religious beliefs, the creation myth is directly from ancient Egyptian beliefs, the flood from Sumerian religions,  Most of the rest is rooted in the Canaanite religion of Ugrate. The messiah story is based on many other religions from around the region and given a new twist. So why would it surprise anyone that their holidays are pagan in origin?"
1,"Because when you are deep within the bubble of delusion as many christians are all things, especially the lie, become possible."
1,"A small number do not celebrate pagan holiday's and follow the teachings of the bible. Still, Jesus did say his following would be few in number.  The Roman Catholic Church (Catholic means universal, hence it incorporates all religion). Constantine worshipped Helios, other names are Apollo son of Saturn ie Chronos. The Jehovah witnesses were started by a freemason,  and the freemason belief goes back to the widows son and Jubal and Jabal, ""the craft"" and two pillars represented in Solomons temple, Solomon turned to pagan worship envoking demons with the seal on his ring (see lesser keys of Solomon), nothing to do with the salvation of Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ and his brother James taught ""obedience.""
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=cUZ5xAVJhI0
http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/jesus/nonchristianaccounts.html"
1,"They do so because they like what those pagans do in their celebrations even though they are not in agreement with bible teachings.  So to get around it they make the claim that those holidays like Christmas are Christian and are based on God's word, iwhch is not the truth.  John 8:32,  "" and you will know the truth and the truth will set you free."""
1,"When Christ was born, the magic were so incredibly happy that they gave HIM gifts. We carry on in this tradition.
Your problem is most likely the shopping, ECT that has little if any to do with the Christ Child. I agree. Its just a tradition for us Christians, that's all I know."
1,Most celebrations were stemmed out of a dumb notions and made into festivities. An opportunists saw money in it and commercialised it.
1,"The bible says Shepherds were watching their flocks by night, well sheep would not be out grazing in December, so yes Christmas was used to covert the pagan holiday saturnalia,  or the birth of sol invictus the unconquered sun."
1,"That is called politics, interfering with other people/country's business."
0,"On the contrary, Israel was delighted.
Was this a serious question?"
1,"Joyce, all of the main functions of the Israeli Gov’t, the Knesset, the PM’s residence, and principal govt departments are located in Jerusalem. Have been for years.
The problem is (surprise!) religion. The pitiful Palestinians (Muslims who, for lack of a better description, are a conquered people) still proclaim Jerusalem as the capital of their “Promised land” (though they have no actual govt) and their claims are buttressed by the parasitic Muslim faith of the region, whose tenuous claim to the city is a fantastical story in the Quran that says Muhammad flew on a white horse to Jerusalem (766 miles from Mecca and back in one night! Simply astounding) to ascend into heaven, from what is now the Dome of the Rock, built (suspiciously enough) atop the old (Jewish) Temple of Solomon.  As firm a basis of a land claim as ever there was.  
Trump merely stated what is obvious. Jerusalem is the functioning Capital of Israel. PM Netanyahu was elated.
But as is their way, the local Muslims (Palestinians and their sycophants) over-responded to a simple statement by a known fool and compulsive liar (Trump) by feigning insult and rioting and burning shops and garbage and cars in their own neighborhoods. Brilliant. 
 (Isn’t it curious how those most sensitive to being disrespected tend to be their own worst enemies?)
Israelis, as is their daily lot, had to hunker down and deal with yet more violent Islamic social dysfunction outside their doors. "

Hawkeye: My father warned me about you...
Cora Munro: [interupting] Your Father?
Hawkeye: Chingachgook, he warned me about people like you.
Cora Munro: Oh, he did?
Hawkeye: He said ""Do not try to understand them"".
Cora Munro: What?
Hawkeye: Yes, and, ""do not try to make them understand you. That is because they are a breed apart and make no sense"".
But seriously, I wouldn't worry about the ""heart"" at all."

You know him better then we do... What does your GUT say.... Not your FEAR?"
1,Just be glad it wasn't kissing face.  Then I'd be concerned.
1,"Do they share personal things, or does she share personal things? After all she's his boss so he has to be a little appeasing. He's not dating her his dating you, if you're concerned ask him about it, he has no problem telling you about what his sent and her reply, so it doesn't sound like his hiding anything.

1,"Joyce, all of the main functions of the Israeli Gov’t, the Knesset, the PM’s residence, and principal govt departments are located in Jerusalem. Have been for years.
The problem is (surprise!) religion. The pitiful Palestinians (Muslims who, for lack of a better description, are a conquered people) still proclaim Jerusalem as the capital of their “Promised land” (though they have no actual govt) and their claims are buttressed by the parasitic Muslim faith of the region, whose tenuous claim to the city is a fantastical story in the Quran that says Muhammad flew on a white horse to Jerusalem (766 miles from Mecca and back in one night! Simply astounding) to ascend into heaven, from what is now the Dome of the Rock, built (suspiciously enough) atop the old (Jewish) Temple of Solomon.  As firm a basis of a land claim as ever there was.  
Trump merely stated what is obvious. Jerusalem is the functioning Capital of Israel. PM Netanyahu was elated.
But as is their way, the local Muslims (Palestinians and their sycophants) over-responded to a simple statement by a known fool and compulsive liar (Trump) by feigning insult and rioting and burning shops and garbage and cars in their own neighborhoods. Brilliant. 
 (Isn’t it curious how those most sensitive to being disrespected tend to be their own worst enemies?)
Israelis, as is their daily lot, had to hunker down and deal with yet more violent Islamic social dysfunction outside their doors. "
1,"To work out your lucky day for gambling, you'll need a little bit of perseverance.

Although it might sound like a lot of baloney to most people, I'm a big believer in cosmic messages.

I also honestly believe that all things in this world are interconnected - if you just look deeper into things, there's always a pattern in every system.

Feeling lucky today? If you're trying to work out your lucky gambling day, there are two things you can do:

Firstly, look out for numerical signs. The universe is constantly sending us messages during our daily life, but - as we aren't 'looking' for them - we often miss them!

Anything from the number of buses that pass you on the street through to the ticket number you get when you're in a queue at the deli can give you an indication of your lucky day.

How to find your lucky gambling day
The second, and probably more important thing to do, is to collect data about your betting patterns.

It might not be as simple as checking which day you win the most money on (often, a lucky day comes once every 3 or 4 months), but if you persevere and analyse enough data - I can 100% guarantee that a pattern will start to emerge.

Once you think you've worked out your lucky day - put it to the test. Try out a few 'safe bets' at first, and if the universe is giving you the green light, then ride that wave!

As with any gambling tactic - the trick is also to know when to draw the line. The best gamblers are using a combination of luck and brains, so to be truly successful, you'll need to use a bit of both too!"

comes from within, whether we are letting our ‘Light’ shine or not, many
of us still want a physically nice smile too.  So when we turn our
attention to dental braces, we come across another highly controversial
subject in the oral health world.
Orthodontic treatment in young children is known as interceptive
orthodontics, and it can begin as early as age 6 or 7. At this age,
teeth are still developing and the jaw is still growing. That means
certain conditions, such as crowding, may be easier to address.

      It is important to note that early treatment does not apply to all orthodontic problems; however, it may help in certain cases.
Let’s start by stating an obvious fact but one that many of us don’t think about commonly.
Our teeth can and do move.  While we don’t want to encourage our teeth to be mobile, they can shift in the mouth.
The unhealthy way teeth shift is through either abrupt or repeated pressure."

Install a video capture device in your computer. This device should come with recording software. The video capture device could be internally installed or an external instrument.

2Tim 4: 3,4  - For there will be a period of time when they will not put up with the wholesome teaching, but according to their own desires, they will surround themselves with teachers to have their ears tickled. 4 They will turn away from listening to the truth and give attention to false stories.
Acts 20:30 - From among you yourselves men will rise and speak twisted things to draw away the disciples after themselves

You can walk into the food bank my family volunteers at and walk out with 3 grocery bags full of nutritios food for a whole month. What most of these people suffer from are addiction and mental health problems.

1,"Christians don't do that,  I think what you are referring to is something that the bible says would be happening after the death of the apostles.  These scriptures explain it
2Tim 4: 3,4  - For there will be a period of time when they will not put up with the wholesome teaching, but according to their own desires, they will surround themselves with teachers to have their ears tickled. 4 They will turn away from listening to the truth and give attention to false stories.
Acts 20:30 - From among you yourselves men will rise and speak twisted things to draw away the disciples after themselves
2Pet 2:1,2 - There will also be false teachers among you. These very ones will quietly bring in destructive sects and will disown even the owner that bought them…..Also, with covetousness they will exploit you with counterfeit words."
1,"Well why would it matter, the entire religion has it's roots in what they call pagan religion. The OT is chock full of other religious beliefs, the creation myth is directly from ancient Egyptian beliefs, the flood from Sumerian religions,  Most of the rest is rooted in the Canaanite religion of Ugrate. The messiah story is based on many other religions from around the region and given a new twist. So why would it surprise anyone that their holidays are pagan in origin?"
1,"Because when you are deep within the bubble of delusion as many christians are all things, especially the lie, become possible."
1,"A small number do not celebrate pagan holiday's and follow the teachings of the bible. Still, Jesus did say his following would be few in number.  The Roman Catholic Church (Catholic means universal, hence it incorporates all religion). Constantine worshipped Helios, other names are Apollo son of Saturn ie Chronos. The Jehovah witnesses were started by a freemason,  and the freemason belief goes back to the widows son and Jubal and Jabal, ""the craft"" and two pillars represented in Solomons temple, Solomon turned to pagan worship envoking demons with the seal on his ring (see lesser keys of Solomon), nothing to do with the salvation of Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ and his brother James taught ""obedience.""

1,"They do so because they like what those pagans do in their celebrations even though they are not in agreement with bible teachings.  So to get around it they make the claim that those holidays like Christmas are Christian and are based on God's word, iwhch is not the truth.  John 8:32,  "" and you will know the truth and the truth will set you free."""
1,"When Christ was born, the magic were so incredibly happy that they gave HIM gifts. We carry on in this tradition.
Your problem is most likely the shopping, ECT that has little if any to do with the Christ Child. I agree. Its just a tradition for us Christians, that's all I know."
1,Most celebrations were stemmed out of a dumb notions and made into festivities. An opportunists saw money in it and commercialised it.
,"The bible says Shepherds were watching their flocks by night, well sheep would not be out grazing in December, so yes Christmas was used to covert the pagan holiday saturnalia,  or the birth of sol invictus the unconquered sun."

1,"Today, most unfortunately, more and more women have started to suffer from hair loss and balding, a problem that was completely associated with middle aged and pot bellied men in the past.
Experts say that they have started to treat patients suffering from hair loss, who are as young as fifteen or sixteen, a time when the girls are in their prime of life and health.
As you must be aware, hair grows at the rate of one half inch every month, and after a certain period of time, ranging from two to six years, it goes into a state of rest, after which it starts to fall out from the hair follicle. This all happens so that a new hair can start to grow from the same place, but for some women, androgens are present in abundance, and when this happens, the natural cycle gets interrupted, and a build up of dihydrotestosterone or DHT takes place. This causes the woman to lose hair.
Experts say that it is vital to maintain hygiene on one's scalp, and when your scalp is oily, it may well lead to the formation of dandruff, which in turn will lead to more hair loss. However, this in itself is not a cause for hair loss."
1,"A number of things can cause excessivehair loss. For example, about 3 or 4 months after an illness or a major surgery, you may suddenly lose a large amount of hair. This hair loss is related to the stress of the illness and is temporary.
Hormonal problems may cause hair loss. If your thyroid gland is overactive or underactive, your hair may fall out. This hair loss usually can be helped by treatmentthyroid disease. Hair loss may occur if male or female hormones, known as androgens and estrogens, are out of balance. Correcting the hormone imbalance may stop your hair loss."
1,"Most people will experience
hair loss in their lives. Oily hair most likely has nothing to do with it, but
it is hard to say. Some people will lose a lot more than others and it applies
to both women and men. Women who lose hair in their younger years could have
thyroid issues, which increases stress, and consequently depletes essential
vitamins and minerals. This alone could cause significant hair loss in women,
no matter their age.
Basically, some stress,
whether it is due to an illness or other not, has the potential to cause hair
loss in anyone. Hair loss is often much more dramatic and noticeable in men but
it can still be a disconcerting because it is hard to know the exact cause
without seeing a professional. Many people use special shampoos and treatments
to help stimulate regrowth and to prevent hair from falling out. Sample Hime or something similar and see if this helps."

1,"Church on sunday was writtten by Billie Joe Armstrong to convince Adrienne not to leave him, and she didn't. They're still together.
Billy Joe met Adrienne at a concert back in 1990.  Speculation regarding their separation was sparked when the couple put their house up for sale last year, however, there are no new news stories stating that they have broken up so it is to be assumed that they are still together.
Adrienne has been asked before if she takes offence at the lyrics that Billie Joe writes and if she worries that they are about their relationship and she has said that he has to write what he feels and that he is just being honest.
many fans dislike Adrienne feeling that she is rude, horrible, totally full of herself and smug, highly arrogant as she has been seen being horrible to fans.It is also suggested that she chooses who gets to meet Greenday and many feel she has no right to decide who gets to met them and who doesn't.  One fan stated ""She is not even an offical celebrity and no one has come to see her.  She either needs to get an agent or a real job"".  Another felt ""She has no right going around in the Crowds cos most fans have not come to see her so she need to get over herself"".
Her husband is rumoured to have been with Groupies and she takes out her mistrust out on the fans and assumes that everyone wants to and is going to be with her husband.  She is mostly spotted having fans removed by security at concerts, walking around in the crowd a signings, being rude to the females who are stupid enough to beleive she is famous.  She thinks she is a big massive famous celebrity and Billie The Doormat will not reel in his wifes fat narcussistic neck in.  She thinks she is in Green Day and gets busy ""interacting with fans"" on fan blog, fan pages etc dispite the reality is that the fans are not her fans to interacting with.  Most fans suck up to her to get to Billie Joe. 
They are also rumoured to be in an open marriage and Billie Joe is seen with several different women.  They are still together but they truly need to just go their seperate ways.  It would be a good idea if that woman stops poking her nose and interfering with his career.  She is not an official celebrity but fans have to suck up to this smug, narcussistic bitch in order to be a fan of Green Day.  She is the Yoko Ono of Green Day and most fans just wish she would fuck off.  She is turning off fans and Billie thinks it is funny when she gets security to push fans out of his way.  He doesn't about the very people who buy their alubms and lifestyle. 
She thinks she is famous and does things like charity endorsements, interviews in magazines, via the web and on TV.  She is always trying to get her frigging face down the lens off the back of her husband because she think she is famous.  IN reality for most people think she a god darn annoyance.  The problem is, there are enough silly girls willing to pander to her to make her think she is an important and special and famous celebrity.  I don't see Billie Joe Armstrong waking up anytime soon.  She is a fame-hungry, materialistic hypocrite and anyone who tells the truth about their dislike for her, they get verbally attacked by internet users lecturing you on how to be a True Fan and by users who claim to know them or claim to be them. 
Why the hell cannot she just go do one and actually get on with her own career (if she has one in the first place) and stop poking her nose in and interfering in her husbands?  Why does she feel the need to ""interact with fans"" - they are not her fans to interact with.  DUH!"
1,"You guys are so freaking full of it. Probably a bunch of wishful thinkers who want BJ single so Adrienne won't get in between you and your fantasies of him. Billie Joe will never divorce Adrienne, and she is not nasty. She is beautiful. And by the way, you may think ""21 Guns"" is about their divorce, but guess what ""When It's Time"" is about? Reading your comments just make me sick. Furthermore, it's natural she would only progress through his career, but need I remind you she's been with him since before they were famous? You REALLY think she has bad intentions?

So they fight. All married couples do. As long as BJ forgives her and continues to love her, you should respect him for it. You're Green Day fans, right? Act like it.

1,You guys honestly are no longer fans because of some fat cow? Really? Did you ever consider he's still with her for the kids? Just ignore her. Obviously if you can't like a band for their music anymore there is something seriously wrong with this world.
1,She's a beast and he should finally leave her.  All you ever hear is stories about them fighting.  He married her when he was pretty much unknown and he has totally outgrown her.  As his popularity grew she became more and more resentful of his fame and all of his female fans.  Time to move on Billie.  You can do much better than her.
1,"Whoever is the guest who posted that Billie's female fans are ""skanks and groupies"" you should be ashamed of yourself and I can not believe you call yourself a Green Day fan when you say something like that about other Green Day fans.   Nobody has ""poisonous jealousy"" for Adrienne.  She is quite unattractive and over weight nobody would have reason to be jealous of her.  Billie should divorce her before he loses all is fans."
1,"No...I don't think they are getting divorced he still seems to be married to ""Minnesota Fats"".  Although the majority of fans just wish he would dump her sorry ass already.  It was said a couple of years ago that they came close to divorcing and most fans were hoping he would have just gone through with it. She is a fat, nasty pig and Billie deserves so much better than the monster he's married to."
1,"I think Billie only adds fuel to the fire by being so public about his fights with her.  I have heard rumors for years about their getting divorced.  Personally, I think he should just divorce her already.  He's way too good for her.  I think she is very resentful of Billie's popularity and is very unkind to his female fans.  Besides being the ugliest woman on the planet, she is also the phoniest woman on the planet and she's very much full of herself.  I was at a record signing for Green Day this past tour.  She was walking around like she was some kind of celebrity, like people were actually there to see her.  But in reality everyone was just like, ""Where's Billie?""  She was nice to you if you were a parent or a child but she was absolutely rude to anyone who was in their twenties or early thirties and was attractive.  Any of those pretty girls she just rolled her eyes and scowled at them.  It really looked as if she was going threw the crowd to check out who was going up to her husband.  I just moved as far as I could to get away from her.  She looks very sloppy and dirty and I was afraid a lice bug would pop out of her hair and jump onto me.  I was not at all impressed by her behavior.  I have no idea what Billie see in her.  She looks like a monster and she isn't even a nice person.  If he is not divorcing her he should.  She will eventually turn off all his fans and train wreck his career.  He deserve so much better."
1,"I heard that they are actually separating.  I am not sure if it is divorce or if they are just separating.  Personally, I think Billie should just leave her.  He can do so much better.  I don't think it's jealousy on the part of the female fans at all.  Rather I think it's jealousy on her part towards the female fans.  Billie has become a huge star and I think she knows he can do a lot better than her and takes it out on his female fans.  I think she is resentful of his success and tries to keep the attractive female fans away from him as much as possible.  I have seen her up close and in person and she is the most unattractive woman alive.  She is also a complete phony.   She is nice to all the kid fans, parents with children - but completely rude and nasty to all the attractive female fans.  She should take a hint - 90% of Billie fans are female.  If she keeps being nasty to them he will lose all his fan base.  I agree if Billie was smart he would just leave her already."
1,"It has been said that the 21 Guns song is really about their impeding divorce.  Many people say that they are no longer together and the sudden sale of the house they have lived in for the past fifteen years is a sure sign of that.  She is a fat, nasty pig and Billie Joe should divorce her."
1,"Why can't you guys just accept Adrienne? She is a beautiful woman and absolutely nice!
Most of her haters are just 13-14, get that Billie would NEVER EVER do anything with you. He isn't a perv, his kids are the same age.
Get of your fu**in' dream-cloud and get a real life, that's just childish.
Love Green Day and Billie Joe with Adrienne or just get another favorite band!
Become a real fan or stop being nasty!"
1,"Well, I here its going on but it might true after Billie made the 21 guns video so if doses true that I heard(:"
1,"It's funny some of you guys say she's ruining his career. How is that so? They got married only a year after Green Day got famous and signed onto Reprise. If she was ruining his career it would have been bad from the beginning.  Songs like She, When It's Time, Pulling Teeth, Minnesota Girl, about all of Green Day's love songs are inspired by her.  Billie even said so himself that he was very suicidal when he was younger and full of empty rage. It was only a miracle he met Adrienne when he did. He wasn't as confident as people thought. Without her, he would be nothing.  She's done nothing but take excellent care of him and their children. As long as he loves her, you should be happy for him and shouldn't even think about why they should get a divorced.She doesn't act all lovey-dovey in public because she doesn't like the attention. She likes to keep their love life private. And I don't blame her.  If she was just using him, she would've drawn the line years ago when he first had a million dollars not years after. She would've took it and left if that was what she wanted. They've been married for years and they truly love each other. Nothing is ever going to change that. I bet my life on it.  :P"
1,"Wow, some of you guys are pathetic to be sitting here making crap up.   You don't know Adrienne or Billie Joe so why are you making up rumors?   And for those of you who wonder if she would stay with him if he was poor, just remember, they met when he was 18, aka in 1990 WAY before Green Day was as big as they are now.   Their private life has absolutely nothing to do with any of you. Yes, he is famous, so yes, people are going to be in his business, but I guess I don't understand why you all care so much if he gets a divorce?   It has NOTHING to do with you!

=)"
1,"It was posted on one day that they are no longer together.  That certainly would explain why their house was put up for sale all of a sudden during the middle of Green Days world tour and just when his kids were starting a new school year.  Also when his house was put up for sale and the local papers listed it, one of the several of the fan sites put up the article.  A day later they were all removed.  It seems they want to divorce quietly?????"
1,I don't know if they are divorcing but I'm so sick of hearing about this droning woman.  She is not accomplished and has done nothing of merit in her life beside get pregnant (at the time) by an up and coming rock star.  She would not have a clothing store or a clothing line with out Billie's money or his name behind it.  No charity would ever be interested in her if she was not married to Billie Joe Armstrong.  So her accomplishments are really Billie Joe's accomplishments.   As for the way the females fans are treated - it's totally disgusting.  Billie Joe needs to wake up and see that a musician is absolutely nothing with out his fans.  Billie Joe said in interviews that before he made it he sold joints for two bucks and if he wasn't a musician he would probably be a drug dealer. (This is not made up - he actually said all these things in interviews - you can look it up.)  I'm just wondering when he loses all his fan base and had to return to his former occupation would she still stay with him.  Would she have even been with him if he never made it and was still doing his former occupation?  Chances are - I think not.   She has stayed with him because he is her meal ticket and it stupid girl fans who she is nasty to who are funding her fancy lifestyle.  If he was smart he would leave her.
1,I am not sure if they are divorcing or not.  I hear some people saying they are and some people saying they aren't.  I agree with most of the comments above that he should finally leave her already.  Billie has admitted in concerts and interviews that they have a lot of nasty fights.  I would tell anyone in that situation that they should just walk away . I hardly think that the fans are jealous of her.  I think it's the other way around.  She looks like a monster.  I'm sure it bothers her that her husband has so many choices of beautiful women to choose from.  He bends over backwards to make her happy and she doesn't seem to appreciate it.  He should just really dump her already.  He's career has taken off and he's totally outgrown her. He could do much better.
1,How is Adrienne accomplished?  What has she done with her life other than having Billie Joe's children.   She had a failed clothing line and anything she tried to do she couldn't have done with out Billie Joe's money.  And she certainly is not beautiful.  Actually she is quite a horror.  He should divorce her already.  I am a little curious how some people on the internet claim to know so many details of their personal life.  It makes me think that you are not just some random person because no fan could possibly know details of his personal life like where he spends Christmas and details of his kid's school.  Sounds more to me like you are actually his Mrs. Or someone very close to her.  And that makes her completely pathetic.  No wonder she is turning away Billie's fans by the drove.
1,"I haven't heard anything official that they are divorcing so I don't think so.  But I do agree with the majority of the comments on here that he should have left her a long time ago.  Probably around the time he wrote the song Redundant.  She is definitely holding his career back and will ultimately just destroy it because she seems to be turning off so many of his fans.  And the likely hood of Billie having a solo career or having any success with a solo project is highly unlikely as long as he is involved with her.  I guess Billie just doesn't realize how many of his fans are female and how this monster he is married to is just turning people off Green Day.  He will wake up when he sees all his fans are gone.  I love Billie Joe with all my heart.  He's a brilliant musician and a hell of a good looking guy, be I will not support his wife's fancy lifestyle anymore. Anyone who is that nasty to fans does not deserve it.  It makes me so sad that Billie Joe has to suffer because of this horrible woman."
1,"I'm not really sure if they are divorcing or not. But you can't go by what you see on TV or what the media says. They claim so many celebrity couples are so happy and in love and the truth is actually quite the opposite.  E.g. Brad Pitt/Jennifer Aniston, Tiger Woods and his Mrs.  So I think you will never really know the truth.  I did see on another website that the song Last Night On Earth is actually an admission to Billie having an affair.  If you listen to the words it only states ""You are the moonlight of my life"" - someone you can only see at night or in secret.  It does not state you are my everything day and night.  And the whole song refers to love being sent to someone who is obviously not close to him.  So maybe they are not divorcing but maybe there is someone else?????"
1,"Most people are saying that they are divorcing.  She was not with him at the American Music Awards and many people are saying that Billie looked very angry and upset at the awards. Besides Billie has given his fans many reasons to believe their is trouble in his marriage with all the tales of the fights he has had with her.  If he is not divorcing her, he should.   She looks like Medusa. Billie seriously has to have a talk with her about personal hygiene and cleanliness.  She's a dirt bag.  She looks like she has never bathed in her life and there's lice in that nasty hair of hers.  BILLIE CAN DO MUCH BETTER THAN THAT UGLY NASTY PIG!!!!"
1,"I heard they are always fighting and their is  a lot of talk about a divorce.  But thank you for letting us know that they are building another house closer to the boys school.  I know now to stop buying everything Green Day related.  I don't think that fat slob of a woman deserves a big fancy house and I don't want my money contributing to fancy houses, cars or schools for her brats.   She is incredibly nasty to the female fans of Green Day and ultimately will destroy Billie's brilliant career.  He is stupid (and apparently blind) for staying with her."
1,Adrienne will not divorce Billie because she is so fat and ugly she couldn't get anyone else even if she tried. Billie will not leave her because she is the only woman dumb and pathetic enough to stay with him when he admits that he is attracted to other men and makes out with men right in front of her.  Ever notice that she has a problem with all the female fans but never has issue with him kissing other men.  HE'S GAY PEOPLE. SHE IS JUST A BEARD FOR HIM.
1,"There are all kinds of rumors going around about Billie Joe including that he is leaving Green Day and going solo.  I think it's absolutely hysterical that this man thinks he can actually have a solo career when his wife is turning his fans off by the dozen.   I do agree with the comment that it makes absolutely no sense to show a married man with kids so much attention.  I think that all the fans should give his wife exactly what she wants and leave him alone.  See what kind of career he will have then.  Let him retire to that fancy house he's building ""closer to his kids school"".  But the fans should definitely stop funding his fat hog of a wife's fancy lifestyle and kid's fancy schools."
1,Honestly who really cares?I agree with all  little fan girls tht billie is HAWT.but hes also obviously in love with adrienne.if he isn't then fine yay billie joe.but let them b 4 now if you really  his fans.o and btw don't stop buying gd merch just because you h8 his wife.your ruining billies life 2
1,"There are some rumors going around that the song ""21 Guns"" is about Addie and Billie Joe getting a divorce, but Billie hasn't said anything about the rumors to deny or confirm them."
1,"You people are awful! Adrienne seems like a lovely woman, and certainly isn't unattractive! I smell jealousy."
1,"I think he should divorce Adrienne.  She is a fat, disgusting worthless piece of s**t."
1,"Well, sorry to be so blunt, but if mentioning to journalists how bad your marriage is, to earn more money, then that's pathetic. There's better ways to earn money. Like a paper boy, for example. C'mon Billie. Are you serious dude?"
1,"Hmmmm...interesting conversation.  I don't think they are getting divorced or anything.  But I do agree that she's is definitely killing his career.  She seem to be the Yoko Ono of Green Day.   I have heard that she is very nasty to the female fans.  And in regards to the comment above that  Adrienne ""needs to keep the skanks and bitches at bay"" that alone is reason for Billie to lose every fan he has.  I have never in my life heard of any spouse of a rock star refer to the female fans of the group as skanks and bitches.  Is this lady for real?  Girls, listen to me - you are all smart, strong women who do not have to take these derrogatory insults from the wife of a rock star.  And I don't believe for one moment that anyone is jealous of her.  She is without a doubt the ugliest woman on the planet.  I think you should all just give her what she wants and just ignore her husband.  She has been insulting to some of you so stop voting for Green Day in awards, stop buying their albums, and stop attending their concerts.  Believe me that will get your message across stronger than all the venting that is being done here.  No rock star who allows his wife to treat deserves to have fans.  And if he is as happily married as
they say he is - isn't chasing a married man with children absolutely fruitless?  Focus on a rockstar or band that will appreciate your attention."
1,"There were all kinds of rumors that the song 21 Guns was about their getting a divorce, but Billie has not confirmed or denied the rumors.  He should divorce her.  He is much too good for her.  She's fat and ugly and he could do much better than her.  And it is a bit strange that he would put up his house for sale while he is in the middle of a world tour.  He has lived there for so many years, it would just make more sense to sell it when the tour was over.  But it mysteriously went on the market in September, just when his kids were starting school and he was about to leave for several months to Europe and Asia.  The timing just seems very odd.  A separation or possible divorce from Adrienne would explain the house being put up for sale all of a sudden.  In any case she is a loser and he is much better off without her."
1,"A good reason?  How about the fact that Billie admits that they fight like cats and dogs?  Sounds to me like he doesn't love her he just hangs around for the kids.   And nobody is jealous of her.  She is a fat, disgusting, slob.  Why would anyone be jealous of her?   The only thing I could say to the last response is if Billie doesn't care about losing his fans then he should.  He admitted in an interview he was not happy being the stay at home suburban dad.  So let him go back to being that or what ever the hell he was before he made it.  I think he was a bus boy or something.  Let 's see if she stays with him when he's a bus boy again.  As a matter of fact the last answer just made me think I was so stupid to be a fan of his.  If Billie doesn't care about his fans he doesn't deserve to have them and I we should be smart to support groups who do care about his fans."
1,"I don't think they are divorcing but he probably should leave her.  I am just curious why when some of you said that you have experienced her being nasty to you why you still support Billie Joe the way you do.  Really? What smart, modern woman gives her full attention to a man who's wife is nasty to them?  Why?  I wouldn't give him the time of day if that were the case.  And if he is as happily married as some of these posts say then isn't absolutely fruitless showing a married man with children attention?  Use your time, energy, and attention elsewhere. Either on yourselves or on someone who appreciates it. Believe me Billie Joe isn't the end all to everything.  There are plenty of bans and rock stars out there who would love you for half the attention you give Billie Joe.  This woman has been crying and belly aching for you to leave her husband alone.  Give her what she wants, wasting your precious attention on him."
1,"I don't think they are getting a divorce but I think he should leave her.  I have to be honest even the guys are sick and tired of hearing about this  whining, ugly  woman.  She is severely hurting Green Day's popularity with the women and if Billie was smart he would see that.  Sometimes I think she would not be happy until she completely ruins his career.  Billie is one of the most gifted songwriters of our generation.  It is so sad that such a genius is having his career ruined by a miserable spouse.  There was even rumors going around about Billie wanting to start a solo career.  I think the success of a solo career is highly unlikely as long as he's married to her.  I also worry about the popularity of Green Day suffering because of her.  I think most fans would be happy if she would just go away."
1,"I think most of the fans think that he should just finally dump her.  She is totally turning off his fans and most fans can't stand her and are turning their back on Billie Joe because of her.  Green Day put out an amazing album with 21 Century Breakdown, but yet other than 21 Guns none of their singles seem to be charting.  Many fans are no longer voting for Green Day in fan based awards or polls.  And most fans are saying they will not see this new musical project of theirs because they refuse to support his fat slob wife's fancy lifestyle anymore.  She is already hurting his career and Green Day's success.  Personally I think he should dump her sorry ass before she totally kills his career all together."
1,"Who are all these ""people"" saying that they are divorcing? I've heard nothing of the sort. In fact they were just pictured holding hands and looking quite in love while Billie and crew were in Australia. Maybe they fight, but that doesn't mean they're divorcing. Many married couples fight, but they still love each other at the end of the day."
1,"I think most people agree that Billie should have dumped her years ago.  But I don't understand why some of you girls let her bother you so much.  She is fat, monstrously ugly and I don't any of you should be giving her the time of day.  I would say the best thing to do is to not give her any attention - just act like she doesn't exist.  If anything you should pity poor Billie for having to be married to such a beast!"
1,"Oh my god people honestly,
1st of all if they have split up then why on earth is she on tour with them
with all their kids in tow too,
adrienne is lovely we waved at her in london at the gig on the barrier, and she waved back loads at us and smiled a lot,
her kids where also there,
why would she be stood side stage watching billie and the boys if they have Split up

they are happy together, stop spreading malicious sad gossip and grow up, they re married I doubt after all this time they re split up
so get a a life,."
1,"Adrienne is the BEST girl that you can see,so I just can say you are nasty jealous because there are a lot of girls jealous of her .THEY W?LL NEVER DIVORCE AND ADIE IS THE BEST G?RL! He loves her you can understand by songs,sentences. They are the best ! Cut it out!"
1,"OK so this is an old post, but I'm so angry I'm gonna have my say, as
the saying goes, better late than never.
This is disgusting,
you people call yourselves fans and you are slagging of the woman he
loves. You're all just jealous bit**es because you wish you could have
him yourselves.
They've been married 19 years and hopefully will still
be married in another 19 years and those who don't like it can F off.
I think they make a lovely couple!"
1,"They should.  All she cares about is trying to get attention and fame off the back of Billie Joe and the kids.  Regarding the fact that it was a manager-led intervention last year, it only prooves she does not care about him as a person.  They only reason why the fans think she is a celebrity is because of her attention-seeking  and desperate need for the limelight because she enjoys it - doing interviews and getting flimed for documentaries and how Billie Joe seems to never get passed an interview without mention her.  She has worked with charities but as a celebrity and has made Green Day fundraise and campaign for the charities she supports.  She tweet to interact with Green Day fans and to tweet about her sons and Billie - she doesnt tweet about herself.  She is just an attention-seeker who has succeeed into getting the attention she thinks she deserves.  Stop bullying other fans into giving her attention as its out of order.  No fan should have to give a wife of a rock star attention in order to be allowed to be a fan of a band that they are not part of and milks for attention.  If Billie Joe died, she would milk his death for attention.  She is has Narcissistic Personality Disorder and anyone who can see her for what she is, are going to get abused.  And I cannot forgive a manager-led intervention.  Billie Joe should not be grovelling to her, it should be the other way around.  She is staying with him for attention, status and fame and the lifestyle.  She is also very manipulative as she has manipulated enough people to enable and back up her delusions of grandeur.  And yes, I do agree with the label of The Yoko Ono of Green Day as she will not stop and is allowed to get attention off of Billie Joe and his success and is allowed to interfere.  If she is so deperate for attention and fame can't she do it properly by signing to an agent to be an official celebrity she so desperately wants to be - off the back of Billie Joes' career?  Its his choice to stay with someone who does this and and she tweeted about an addictive perscription pill more than once and then went through her twitter deleting them..  Epic fail.  If he truly wants to be drink and drug free a radical change is needed but its obvious why he sticks with her and remember she came out of a punk scene too and was not straight edge....so go figure.  The fan shouldnt even know who she is.  Its ultimitately both their fault by letting her get attention in the first place and for being so public about their relationship.   All she cares about is the limelight and the attention that people give her.  She is not only in love with herself but in love with the limelight.  She makes me want to puke and more importantly what really annoys me is that there are enough sychophants to bully anyone who is rational enough to see her for what she is.  A limelight-loving attention-seeker using her family and grabs every opporunity she can to turn the attention and limelight onto her including all the interviews and the publicity etc -  at some point in the communication thread whether it is the journalist that drops or she allows for the journalist to drop -  publicity for that eco shop she has at some point Billie Joe Armstrong name is dropped and uses Emilys Army for gaining attention too.  Also there are plenty of Eco and fairtade and handmade artiscan shops around the Oakland and San Franisco area so why does her shop get so much attention and publicity?"
1,To the people that talk negative about Adrienne have you actually met her or you just going by what you see online?.  Has anyone actually met Billie after 2012 and had a negative experience?.
1,"My husband was so smooth at hiding his infidelity so I had no proof for months, I was referred to some hacker and decided to give him a try.. The result was incredible because all my cheating husband's text messages, whatsapp, facebook and even phone conversations was wired directly to my cellphone.

1,"You guys are assholes for talking like this. You say she's ugly, but are you sure you aren't looking in a mirror? Seeing your personality maybe? And she is no reason to stop loving Green Day, you pathetic gossips."
1,Did anyone see the grammy awards? Adrienne was there and Billie kissed her when he/green day won. Still together.
1,"Come on, honestly? Billie Joe and Adrienne are the cutest couple, and she's beautiful! They would never get a divorce! The way they met is the sweetest thing, by the way :)"
1,I'm laughing my ass off at how many green day fans are wasting their time getting mad over this. I'm a huge ass green day fan and I think its completely ridiculous that you people take it so seriously.
1,"Regardless of this woman's looks, age, or weight, it's personality to be concerned about. If she's a jerk, then she is, so then don't spend money on Green Day anymore. If she's kind, smart and funny, then she is, so be inspired by her. I can guarantee not one person writing here knows her personally.

Anyone telling these angry fans they're not Green Day fans because they dislike Adrienne is RETARDED. The fact everyone is getting so upset, on BOTH sides of the argument, shows each person is a concerned fan. The bottom line is, she's just another celebrity in the spotlight for people to disect. As Amy Lee says, ""If people are making fun of you, you're probably doing something right."""
1,"Guys.... You really are so unfair
she's beautiful and lovely.
Personality I love bj and adrienne, if she never meet him, he never would be were he are now
cause she help him and love him very much
so, stoping this f*cking conversation"
1,Jesus Christ peoplee theyy are never going to divorce theyy love eachh otherr if you likedd billie Joe you woould knoww that he has saidd menii timess Adrienne is the only woman he will ever lovee Therr happy andd therr a great couplee
1,"Well the thing is any seperation or rumored divorce is only coming from her.  She has left him twice so far over the past 15 or so years and she has always has come back to him.  I cannot understand why he is still with someone who is allegedly horrible to his fans and acts as if she is some sort of celebrity, as if we actually care about what she thinks, feels or says.  Just because she is wife and muse of a musican does not gave her the right to act horrible, or give her copy wright rights to the music.  Her attitude sucks and she looks like a horrid drug-addled over-grown Groupie.  Being a muse to a musican is not a career option.....When she left him in May he was really really hurt by it and when he was on TV performing ""Last of The American Girls"" he looked as though he was going to break down in tears.  So any divorce would be coming from her.  It is a shame that he chooses to be with someone who is so smug, arrogant and nasty to fans and who people accuse others of being jealous of if we say anything else other than that she is such a wonderful, beautiful, kind, saintly, lovely person....etc.  We do not care.  And she seems to me that she has this attitude of ""Look at me, look WHO I'M with and your not...haa haa haa - smirk, smirk"" is horrible.  I am quite miserable that even someone like Billie Joe Armstrong will go for and continue being with someone never fails to have an attitude.  She needs to go home, get some perspective, get  a reality check, get a pair of sissors and cut those nasty deadlocks off and take a shower.  Then say sorry to everyone she has been nasty to and to Billie for acting like a diva. I do not like her, not because I am a 14 year old it is because she comes accross as arrogant and horrible and mean."
1,"All of you people agreeing that Addie and Billie should get a divorce, you clearly aren't Green Day fans. Fans worship the band and want what's best for them AND their members.
Let's start with my 1st arguement.
Firstly, someone here stated that ""He admitted in an interview he was not happy being the stay at home suburban dad. So let him go back to being that or what ever the hell he was before he made it. I think he was a bus boy or something. Let 's see if she stays with him when he's a bus boy again.""
This is completely wrong. Infact, Billie Joe met Addrienne WHILST touring BEFORE Green Day were even famous! Billie Joe had been in the band since he and Mike were 15. They started the band. Billie Joe said in MTV: Behind The Music, Green Day special, that Addie had nothing to do with the band. She wasn't a roadie or anything. He just met her on the street, and he happened to be touring with the band in that area, WHEN HE WAS 19 YEARS OF AGE! Billie is now 39 years old as of early 2011.
My second arguement.
I've read MULTIPLE comments on here saying that Addie is wrecking Green Day and Billie Joe's career.
Once again, read my first arguement. Billie Joe was so in love with Addie, he had this infatuation he could not break. He got the band to tour again in the area where Addie lived, so he could see her again. This tour would have, no doubt, mad the band get A LOT more fans and followers. This was all before the band was even popular. Billie Joe, Mike and Tre all lived in an apartment together, with Tre's dad driving them in a tour bus. That is the time that Adie and Billie fell in love. PROVING that she didn't marry him for his money or fame.
My final arguement.
Someone commented ""She is incredibly nasty to the female fans of Green Day and ultimately will destroy Billie's brilliant career. He is stupid (and apparently blind) for staying with her.""
This is one of the most disgusting biased opinions I've ever heard. If I knew who that person was I would certainly strike that person down for being so rude and cruel to someone who they've probobly never even met to get a decent opinion of her!
Billie Joe is his own person. He can do whatever he wants. He can marry who ever he wants. I'm not joking, at least half of Green Day's songs are about his wife. The song ""Last Of The American Girls"" a perfect example. It is about Addie, and is also a popular radio song. Many other GREAT songs by green Day have been inspired and written about Addie. Therefore, she is NOT ruining Green Day. She was Billie's Girlfriend before they were even popular, and she always has been. No doubt if Addie WASN'T Billie's wife, Green Day wouldn't even be HALF as popular as they are now. All of you biased commenters probobly wouldn't even know who green Day were if it wasn't for Adie.
Just because Billie Joe is an extremely attractive man, and that plenty of females would like to date him, doesn't mean he isn't allowed to have a wife. I have talked to many many many female fans of green Day, who think that Adie is the most beautiful women in the world. Some of these people have even met and had the chance to have a normal conversation with her. She is a beautful women who inspires Green Day so much. Sure, Billie has stated that they fight, but all couple have their fights! It's what keeps them so strong and close.
I can tell you that Billie Joe has talked about how he loves Addie so much, much more frequently than when he talks about them fighting.
Billie Joe and Addie ARE NOT Getting a divorce. They love eachtoher VERY much. Just because they are a family, does not mean she is a horrible person who only wants Billie for his kids and money.
I rest my case.
Rage n Love.
~Kahlia~"
1,"I have no idea on whether they are getting divorced or not.  But I will say that this woman is totally turning me off of Green Day.  The more I hear about her the less and less of a Green Day fan I become.  I don't know where you people are getting your information from, especially the person who says they know they are building a house closer to the kids school.  You just sound like a stalker.  I don't see that Billie put out this statement in any interview.  So how do you know it????  I will agree with the statements that she is a fat, disgusting, ugly slob and Billie SHOULD finally divorce her already.  This woman has done nothing of merit in her own life and she is not part of Green Day.  Billie should lead by example. Enough about his big fat wife and more about the music.  If he was smart he would see how she is hurting his career and how she is turning off all of his fans."
1,"Hey... I`m German, my english is not so good.... But I want to tell some words: I think you`re all unfair! Adrienne is his wife of 15 years, it`s alone Billies decision, if he get with her or not. I think she`s a beautiful mother and a beautiful wife. Nobody know him or her... Nobody here knows, as they live and on the face of their family-life. It´s only because everyone thinks, Billie is hot and for this reason everyone find his wife shitty... Maybe Billie is private an asshole and all he does is only show and commercial, who knows?! Also how can you know, that Adrienne is shitty? My opinion is, that the female fans are jealous of her and for this reason they set everyone on her. Let they live their life and you live your life and good is... And for the last: Who cares, if they get a divorce or not?"
1,"They fell in love 15 years ago. They are still together. Billie doesnt give a s*** if you think she's ugly, unattractive or untalented. He loves her for who she is, and he definitely doesn't care about losing fans because of her. It's not like someone who actually like the music would stop doing that because of Adrienne. That is pathetic if anything. You have absolutely nothing to do with his life!

Adrienne loves her man, support him when his on tour and taking care of the kids.
Just like her, Billie want to support his wife.

Grow up and wait til you get married and have kids. Then you might understand.

And if someone else wants to tell us why they should get a divorce, please give me one good reason, not one about her looks (because that's not a reason), and you will probably find out that there is none. Well, you might finally get that you are jealous. But that we already knew."
1,I don't think they are getting divorced but I think he SHOULD divorce her.  She is a nasty slob and hands down the ugliest woman alive.   I also think it's funny that he thinks he could have any kind of a  solo career or solo side project when she is doing her best to turn off every female fan he has (the majority of Billie's fans are female).  I think she will not be happy until she totally destroys his career.   The only really smart comments here is that the female fans should not help support this ugly monster's elaborate lifestyle.  And as much as I love Billie if he allows her to behave like that then he really does not deserve the fans he has.  Maybe when he realizes he is losing fans he will finally do something about her.
1,"I don't think that they are divorcing but I definitely think he should divorce her.  He's totally outgrown her and she is totally ruining his otherwise brilliant career.  I feel so bad that she has turned off so many of Billie's fans.  A big thump on the head to her.  She is obviously not too bright because she should know that you don't bite off the hand that feeds you.  It's the fans spending money on their concerts, merchandise, etc. That has afforded this pig her fancy lifestyle.  I don't blame the fans who want to turn their backs on Billie because of her.  But it's so sad that Billie has to be hurt because of her.  Really you girls should just laugh at her.  She is so pathetic.  She's fat, she's ugly, and just the pathetic excuse for a woman.  Her husband has admitted in interviews being attracted to men while married to her.  Sounds more to me like Adrienne is more worried and jealous at the hundreds of good looking fans that flock to see Billie.  If she is nasty to you laugh in her face or throw a donut her way. That will certainly get rid of her.  But try not to make Billie suffer because of her actions.  He's a really great guy and Green Day is a great group.  They shouldn't suffer because of this fat hog."
1,I think just about everyone thinks he should divorce her but I haven't heard that they are separating - although people have said for years that they fight like cats and dogs.  I have always wonder why he just doesn't cut her loose already.  She is absolutely hideous.  I vomit in my mouth everytime I see a picture of her.  But you never really know what goes on in a marriage.  Just the other day Out magazine did an interview with Billie Joe.  He admits to being bisexual and admits to having feelings for men while married to her.  It's there in print you can see it.   I have to think that besides being hideously ugly she is the most pathetic person alive.  What kind of woman stays with a man who admits to having feelings for men while he is married to you.  Only a sad woman like her.  You girls shouldn't be upset by her - you should laugh in her face.
1,"I'd say the majority of you would not have gone near BJ unless he was famous. Adrienne & BJ fell in love when he was a nobody & they have been together through the rough & the smooth.  I don't blame her wanting to keep the skanks & groupies at bay...btw, there are kids involved here & please be aware that they could come across these websites and you should all grow up and get over your poisonous jealousy.  As much as you would love to believe they may be separating, I hope they don't and especially not for reasons of keeping the fans happy.  Do you honestly think he'd be blackmailed into dumping his Mrs to keep the fans happy...pure delusional B.S.  I too also think BJ is very hot but have the respect for him as a husband and a father.  When I met him in October he turned out to be one of the most charming, polite men I have met who is famous - guys grow up and wish him and his family well instead of your vicious gossip mongering. If you don't want to buy Green Day's records then that is your choice but there a thousands of us out there who will."
1,"Everyone who is slamming Adrienne because of her looks should be ashamed of themselves. It is none of your business how she looks. Billie loves her and for everyone to be going on about how much of a fat slob she is is absolutely dissapointing. You guys call yourselves green day fans, I wouldn't class you guys as fans. And as for Billie and Adrienne's arguments that is perfectly normal, if you have been with someone for basically half your life then you are going to have disagreements. And I wouldn't say that she is jealous of Billie's fans, I would say that you guys are jealous of her because she was able to find the man of her dreams and have a really happy and fulfilling life. And if all your interested in is Billie's relationship then stop being a fan of Green day's because there is more than one person in the band and they are just as important as Billie."
1,"This discussion is hilarious.  Adrienne is an extremely accomplished, educated, and beautiful person who captured Billie's heart and soul years ago.  Why is there an impression that the house was put on the market ""all of a sudden?""  How would you know that? How do you know they didn't spend time redecorating/refurnishing in order to sell it?  Have you seen the interior pictures?   She and Billie and the boys spent time at their house in Mnneapolis over Christmas and they seemed to be perfectly fine. I live there and saw them out to eat one night and at a show in Dinkytown.   I've been a Green day fan for many years and I've had the good fortune to meet them both, separately and together, several times.  For the people who are saying they can't be Green Day fans anymore because of Adrienne, that's probably for the best.  If you don't respect and appreciate his relationship with her and what she means to him, you'll never truly undersatnd Billie, or Green Day for that matter.  Hate to sound cheesy, but good riddance to you and I hope to never see you at a show."
1,"No divorce guys. They are building new house closer to the boys school. If you think Adi is fat then you must have a very strange view of people......do you live in America?  As most people there are 5 times Adi's size.

Stop your nonsense and enjoy the music!!!!"
1,"My husband works in the Hotel Green Day stayed at in Sydney, Australia, Billie was there with Adrienne. He says they are both really nice people and certainly looked very much in love. All the kids were with them too (Billie and Adrienne's and Mike's). This was at the beginning of December so obviously they are still together."
1,"No, I don't think that they are getting a divorce but I do agree that Billie should have dumped her years ago.  I can't believe that he is even married to that creature.  She is the ugliest woman I have ever seen in all of my life.  She makes you want to vomit just looking at her.  I have heard she is incredibly nasty to Billie's female fans.  But I don't think you should let her upset you.  I would just laugh in her face because she is completely pathetic and laughable."
1,"No, no divorce.  Billie seems to be married to Fat Mama Cass and I don't see that he is leaving her anytime soon.  Why would he she is the only woman stupid enough to stay with him while he admits that he is attracted to men.  He just did an interview with Out Magazine where he admits it.  She stay with him because she is so pathetic, fat and ugly, really no one else would want her.  If SHE had any self respect she would leave him but just look at what a fat, ugly slob she is.  Does this look like a woman who has any respect for herself????"
1,"Here`s the german girl again... At the guest above these comment: THANX! That`s my opinion, too. You bring it to the point. I can`t explain my comment so good, because my english is terrible ;-) All these people here are unfair. And as I say: Who cares, if they get a divorce or not?????? But the discussion is amazing :-))"
1,"They met when they were young, he has written many love songs, he loves her, the way she is. People should stop carrying about looks, and being so ....just stupid, ....Are looks really all that matter ??? NO, he loves her and only her. And I think she is very brave and (it's something I couldn't do)  she lets him kiss guys because it's a tradition!
....Addie  loves Billie joe! They married as soon as they were able to.
They married in like 5 minutes. IN their backyard.
They were young, and in love, neither knew that Green day would be such a success, addie wouldn't have cared if he wouldn't have been a celebrity, they just loved each other...

DO YOU all not believe in unconditional love????
If you don't...you are an IDIOT

80 loves BJ and BJ loves 80"
1,"I am a woman of good taste and I LOVE Billie joe as much as the other person but,I think you should just leave his personal life alown.I mean where aloud to have bf and gf but why not him?I think he should be-able to have a wife without ANY trouble.SO LEAVE HIM alown!!!"
1,This is seriously horrible. I've been a green day fan forever. I love their music and think that they are purely amazing. Those of you who are putting Adrienne down in the dirt should be ashamed of yourselves. Billie joe and her have been together for so long. Its pretty clear that they love each other. I think she is a gorgeous woman and those of you calling her fat.. You have to remember that she did give birth twice and considering I think she still looks amazing. You people who call yourselves fans and cut down green days loved ones disgust me! You definitely don't deserve to be a true green day fan. Adie has been inspiration to billie joe. I don't see him writing songs about you so get over yourselves.
1,"They are still together but obviously most fans thing he would be better off without her.  They seem to argue a lot though.  Most fans resent her to some degree while others seem to suck up to her because they think that they should to keep Billie Joe happy so that he is not angry.  When I hear she is allegedly horrible to the fans it really makes me livid.  If it is true, she should know better.  Also if it is true, she does not deserve him at all if that is the case.   Oviously he is seeing something entirely different from what most of the fans are seeing.  Why can't we see this side more?? She seems to me totally taking him for granted and most fans just thing that he should dump her."
1,"Oh come on I am 14 years old...And WTH is your talking about...Just listen to their music...I am a big fans of green day,, Wake up dude.....""Dreams are dreams"" ...I'm crazy by Billie Joe Armstrong....and I think Addie is beautiful....Getting divorce or not,, is it just their own problem...nothing to do with us! Fat, Ugly, Disgusting slob...Pay attention all of you,,, stand up in the mirror  and you'll see ""HOW BAD YOU ARE"" beauty is not only from face, body, from
heart either.  ""GREAT ANSWER"" or ""NOT HELP"" you are just vote if its answer said that ""Billie should leave her"" then you vote NOT HELP answer. You are not asking but hopeless. I don't think that they are getting divorce,, I think you'll vote NOT HELP, FYI, IDTS."
1,"I think everyone should just leave Adi alone :( Billie Joe loves her so much. There such a nice couple, and they've been together for like, what, 20 years now? I hope the never get a divorce, there such a cute family. 
Stop being so jealous of her and instead, be happy for her! I think she's the luckiest person in the world :) 
It makes me sick to read all the bad things that people say about her. I can't imagine how much it would hurt reading something like that if it were me. And everyone knows how crazy punk rock concerts can get xD Adi is just making sure that Billie Joe doesn't have to dive onto anybody or kick his fans out like he has done a couple of times before xD it would put me in a bad mood if someone was being a dick at my concert and i had to kick them out myself. 
So leave her alone! :("
1,"Church on sunday was writtten by Billie Joe Armstrong to convince Adrienne not to leave him, and she didn't. They're still together"
1,"No, he is not"
1,"Billie Joe Armstrong is not divorcing his wife because the King of Punk likes his woman old, fat and ugly.  He also likes his men young, thin and pretty."
1,"Okay first of all, regardless of whether they are getting divorced or not, what the Hell gives any of you the right to be so bitchy about Adrienne? Fair enough if any of you actually know her and have decided you don't like her, but honestly, how many of you is that? In fact how many of you know Billie personally and can vouch for him being everything he projects himself to be in the media, behind closed doors? Who the Hell knows the full story, and unless you are their family (very unlikely!) what business is it of yours whether they fight all the time, or they're getting divorced or not?! Secondly, as none of you have anything to do with their marriage and most if not all of you do not know them personally, what right do you have to say whether Billie should divorce Adrienne and that she's not good enough for him? They've been married for about 15 years now so I think if anyone can decide whether Adrienne is good enough for him, it's Billie! Third, Green Day are a band, they produce music - I always thought that by saying you liked a certain band you are stating that you are a fan of their music, and I honestly don't see how the way a person behaves towards their fans can change their views on their music, which is essentially what being a fan of a band is all about, isn't it? It amazes me that people can be so judgemental about situations that don't concern them."
1,"The fact that they have had so many marital problems is no big secret.  Billie should have dumped her years ago.  She is incredibly nasty to Green Day's female fans.  But it is interesting to know that he is building this nasty cow another house.  I will know not to purchase any more Green Day merchandise or concert tickets.  It really bothers me that she is such a nasty, fat slob and it's us stupid fans who are putting her up in another fancy house with all of the money we spend on Green Day stuff.  Billie can just do concerts for his ugly wife in their new home.  ""Jump Heffer, Jump, Jump, Jump""  ""Get those hands in the air, Fatso"" ,  ""Say Hey ----oooooooo, ugly!!!!"" If he is stupid enough to keep her, then he should just disappear with her.  It is such a shame because he could have an absolute AMAZING career and really become one of the legends of rock.  This fat slob is totally ruining his brilliant career."
1,She is a fat ugly pig who bitches and whines about the difficulties of being married to him.  She looks like Medusa. He SHOULD DIVORCE HER.  I tend to think that there may be some truth to the rumors as he all of a sudden put his house up for sale in September.  It seems extremely odd that someone would put their house up for sale while he is in the middle of a world tour.  One would think that he would wait until the tour was over and was home before he did that.  The fact that his house was all of a sudden put up for sale does make it seem that their is truth to their separation or maybe a divorce is in the works.
1,"This whole fighting wouldn't be happening if them darn kids get off my lawn. :v

Their relationship isn't any of your business. If they were getting a divorce, they would have already divorced now. If Billie says he loves her, then let it be. You don't run their lives.

Okay now let's all stop fighting and love now."
1,"I honestly don't know. I think people are jealous of her because they are hoping he will leave her and marry them. Btw: GET OVER IT! He loves her to death and that doesn't give you any reason to say mean things about her. Even if she is being nasty to female fans that doesn't mean that you should boycott green day completely. They're a great band and just because one of them might possibly have a snobbish wife doesn't mean that you can't like them. Billie joe also isn't using her as a cover up for being gay. He's bi and he chose to marry a woman in the end. And if you think adrienne is fat, ugly, or medusa like, then I have no idea what's wrong with you."

And one more thing, ""GET THESE LIFE STEALING MEXICANS OUTTA MY COUNTRY!"", and ""BRING THE TROOP'S HOME!"""
1,"Billie was with his wife of nearly 16 years at the Grammys looking very happy and in love. Get over yourselves. He's not going to leave her. He loves her and she has stuck with him through good times and bad. Their marriage isn't perfect, but whose is? They love each other and are committed to each other and that's all that matters. Couples fight. It's a fact. That doesn't mean they don't love each other, or want to get a divorce."
1," would you people just get over the fact that billie loves adrienne and adrienne loves billie! I think shes a beautiful woman stop calling her a beast ! If billie broke up with adrienne he would have already done it by now!And if Adrienne broke up with Billie he wouldnt be able to write all of the songs we love so stop being a green eyed monster !! Billie loves Adrienne and we love GREEN DAY!!! Ang yes he admitted when his first son Joey Marciano Armstrong was born that he is bisexual theres nothing wrong with that ! It obiously dosnt bother Adrienne and that a good thing not to be jealous . So you people that hate her get over it Adrienne loves him,and he loves Adrienne !"

1,"Yes I do. Why- because he is the sustainer of life, and every breath."
1,"Q ""Do you believe in God? If yes, then why?""
1. There are only two positions here. One that allows for the possibility of God and the other one that rules out any possibility of God. There is no position in between.
2. It's an undeniable fact that there has never been any evidence to back up the position that rules out any possibility of God.. There is no evidence now, for that position, and we already know [it's a foregone and guaranteed conclusion] that there will never be any evidence for that position. It is therefore a dead loss, and it makes no sense, to take that position.
3. I agree with all those who say that there has never been any direct evidence for God. I also agree that even now [at the time of posting this] there is no direct evidence for God. However, NOBODY can guarantee that there will NEVER be any direct evidence for God. It therefore makes far more sense to take up the position that allows for the possibility of God than to take up the position that rules out any possibility of God."

Just as the serpent or shining one beguiled Eve with the knowledge of good And Evil, duality, the self we were separated.
The hermetic or gnostic has similar story about Sophia (wisdom) trying to create without her consort understanding - Christ.

The things we are taught in church is planetary worship. However the occult or hidden meaning is kept from us and it's made the church rich. However, secular also includes the same story in there rituals and media.
The chequered floor represents duality. We came from one and now are two.
Kabbalah is seen in many things alot of celebs are in to it. You hear about the sephirah but not the Quiloth - evil tree.
Lilith rules over Malcoth (material world)in Quiloth.
Lilith is equated with the black moon
You'll see alot of singers have ritually turned bad in pop Beyonce was ritually blown up in her car in Crazy Right Now and emerged this sexy dark women, the same happened to Rihanna who often equates herself eith Inanna aka Lilith
 She sings umbrella, this word comes from latin Umbra which means shadow or ghost.  She sings it is raining Jay z is the Rain man, who is samael or satan reigning money, riches etc, 
and she invites you to stand under her shadow.

They want you to appeal to your shadow self your dual character, the subconscious where Lilith lays waiting she is equated with the Moon, the lesser light. She is the temptess the opposite of eve, she is The Queen of the Night.

Many songs are about Lilith and the shadow self, also called Layla, Lilly, Lucy.  Many of these songs relate to the midnight hour, magic or the witching hour.
The goat is equated with the beastly nature of man, especially sex. If man does not believe in God then he does not believe in a spiritual self he believes is purely material, ""a material girl iving in a material world."" He will not seek another way out and will either decine losing the battle with his beastly self or he'll die a death for the spirit is not in him. This is why John talks about being born of spirit. All men are born of flesh they must be born of God. Even some Jews believe in reincarnation and Jacobs ladder.
 There battle between  of good v evil and you choose. Jesus the son tries to shine light, promote altruism,  love thy neighbour, do not store up riches, this is because the measure of a man is weighed in the heart. 
The ancients knew about the zodiac the celestial realm, but they also believed the sun was a material object, but Gods light wasn't. We battle with our own darkness and each others everyday and some want us giving into perversion, lust and violence which is why television is packed with it, this entertains your shadow, your subconscious cannot tell the difference from a story and reality."

Like most things in this life, if you pay money you generally get a better deal than the freebie version.
Having said that, sites like Phonelookup.com (I know, how did they think up the name?) are useful services that won't cost you a dime.
The downside is that they simply don't have access to all the phone data in the world, so there's always a chance you'll draw a blank...
Another option would be to check out the leaky bank of private data that is Facebook. You'll be surprised just how many people publish their phone details on Facebook, especially now that more and more people sign up and use the service from their mobile devices.

A = 9
B = 2
C = 2
D = 5
E = 13
F = 2
G = 3
H = 4
I = 8
J = 1

T = 7
U = 4
V = 2

X = 1
Y = 2
Z = 1
* = 2
Words With Friends therefore consists of 104 tiles all in all.

This online scrabble game has millions of Facebook and cell-phone users. It's based upon the traditional scrabble game that is played by forming words from individual letter tiles in either a vertical or horizontal manner.

Each tile comes with a corresponding score which is related to the difficulty in using that letter to form a word. Less frequently used letters such as 'Q' carry more points. The objective of the game is to come up with a word with the highest score. Only words that can be found in a Standard English dictionary may be used.

Words with Friends has more than 173,000 permitted words listed in the Enhanced North American Benchmark Lexicon (ENABLE). ENABLE is popularly used as a reference for many of the other word games online.

The rules of the game are similar to Scrabble itself. The game ends when every tile is used, and there are no tiles remaining. The game could also end if in three successive turns, no score was drawn for each player."

1,"Don't forget that there are two Blank tiles that can be used in place of any letter you need. The way to check the number of letters on the board is to see if any of them have no score value. When a blank tile is played, there is no value number on it whereas every other tile has a value."

years ago, before either arcades or home video games, visitors waited in
line at Brookhaven National Laboratory to play “Tennis for Two,” an
electronic tennis game that is unquestionably a forerunner of the modern
video game.

Tennis for Two was first introduced on October 18, 1958, at one of
the Lab’s annual visitors’ days. Two people played the electronic tennis
game with separate controllers that connected to an analog computer and
used an oscilloscope for a screen. The game’s creator, William
Higinbotham, was a nuclear physicist lobbied for nuclear
nonproliferation as the first chair of the Federation of American
Scientists."

1,"If your Tinder app freezes half way through using it, that can be pretty annoying.. Especially when you've started a conversation with someone you've matched with.
Anyway, there are a few things you can do if your Tinder app freezes to get it going again. Better still, there's a trick to making sure Tinder doesn't freeze again too.
Method 1 - unfreezing your Tinder app
Double click the home button. This should show you the Tinder app zoomed out. Now swipe up on the window showing the Tinder app. This will shut down the app. Next step is to launch Tinder again, and it should work.
Method 2
Still not working? Try turning your phone off completely, then back on again. Launch the Tinder app. Any luck?
Method 3
If Tinder still keeps freezing, you may want to check that you have the latest version of Tinder. You check if you need an upgrade by opening the app store and selecting the upgrades tab.
Method 4
Now, I really recommend you watch this review of the Tinder App. It's hilarious, but also soooo true!

1,"The internet is full of free pornography, and many sites are also catching up with the trend by becoming mobile-friendly.

This is great news for porn connoisseurs around the globe - many of whom are sick of finding access to their favorite x-rated sites restricted when they attempt to browse them using a mobile device.

The iPhone users guide to porn
As a smartphone user myself, I totally understand the challenges that finding porn on an iPhone entails.

Even some of the biggest names in the porn industry have yet to update to a responsive web design (a website that's designed to be viewed regardless of your device's size - no pun intended).

This conundrum leaves iPhone users struggling to use adult sites which are often skewed or impossible to navigate on a smaller screen.

Let me tell you, when you've got your hands busy, using a non-mobile site on a small touchscreen is no easy task!

Granted, some sites do have mobile versions, but these rarely offer as much content as does the full-screen experience.

What are the best sites for free iPhone porn? Based on some unsatisfactory experiences myself, I decided to do some research into which mobile porn sites generate the most traffic.

At first, I was discouraged to find that search engine results for 'best mobile porn site in the world' returned a list of poor-quality, pop-up-heavy adult websites.

I then decided that the only way to find the best mobile porn site would be to examine published figures regarding mobile video traffic.

According to an article ironically posted on blackberryreview.com, the best porn sites for iPhone users are the following (all of these rank in the top 10 mobile video sites overall):

xvideos.com
youporn.com
pornhub.com
tnaflix.com"

1,"Mostly, yes. But I never bothered with cliques or trying tp be popular. I had a core group of 4 friends and were are still friends to this day. (And high school was a very long time ago.) "
1,"Yeah, it was. Still have some of those friends."
1,Not really.
1,"Overall, it was a great time.  I loved the football games and dances, and I had known most of my friends since elementary school.  Many of us have remained close friends  ..... Although, sadly, our numbers are diminishing with each passing year."
1,Everyone went their own way after school so i say it was funny
1,"If I knew then what I know now.  It would have been more fun.
I studied hard, worked a p-time job in the winters and a f-time job in the summers. I probably could have partied more."
1,"Nothing abt school was fun for me. I was shy and awkward from being picked on constantly. So when someone was nice to me, I thot they had hidden motives"

1,"""... A few months ago ...""
Since you don't mention anything happening since then ... You either trust him or you don't.  If you don't trust him, you shouldn't be his girlfriend."
1,"I've been cheated on too, so I know how you feel. But, honestly, if it wasn't the guy you are with now that cheated, you have no reason to not trust him. Now if he did it more than that once, yeah you could be worried. But I assume he deleted the picture, right? If he kept it, that would be a reason to get mad. (As I can tell you don't like the fact he got the picture at all.) It wouldn't hurt to just explain this to him and just ask if he talks to the girl or not. If he talks to her, you could ask him not to. It's your relationship, you're allowed to speak up if you don't like something."
1,"Well, really....he can't control what other people send him, if it's a picture of a dog or someones breasts. Did you ever think it might be a female who wants to break you up so she can have him? Just a thought......it's just a picture."
1,"I would call that crossroads. Don't trust him, maybe I'm wrong about him, but it's better than regretting it. If you can't communicate with him and figure it out between you two then there is no point. And that would make no sense to trust someone in that situation.
He is more then likely, messing with your head. Understand?"
1,I suggest you talk to your mom. And tell her if that is really healthy for the family and herself because of what she is doing
1,F your mom. Tell your dad about it. You need to be on his good side when they get divorced because he's going to get all the money since your mom is a lying cheating wh*re.
1,I'm good at staying out of situations like that.
1,"No thank you. It would not be my place to interfere in my parents' marriage. If there was infidelity going on, sooner or later things will blow up in the cheater's face without my help."
0,"Why do you distinguish between a ""parent"" and a ""spouse?""---is that significant in this situation?"
1,"Locking their phone, taking calls in another room away from you, whispering on the phone, buying new clothes, mainly sexier types of undergarments, wearing makeup more often, having excuses to leave the house (like ""oh, I forgot to get milk, I have to run out and get some), not as affectionate with you as she once was. There's a lot of signs to look for, but basically if you suspect it, it's probably true. Everyone should always trust their gut feeling."
1,"Well, if the other one is cheating on you then the first sign would be he won't be able to look you in the eye, and he'll find himself less confident while speaking to you about anything. He will start giving you excuses for silly things, say you ask him to go out for something may be a movie or a dinner, and if he is really cheating on you then he surely will be concerned about the other person and will not like to mingle around with you most of the times. And you are the best person to judge on this. Its your life and you are the decision maker here. So make a move after knowing everything."
1,"Signs of cheating include: Hiding things from you, lying, going out more(w/o you), staying out late, any changes in routine, changes in your sex life, wanting to look good & smell good when they didn't before, anything that is out of the norm. Or is out of character for them, being distant, less affectionate and giving you less attention..etc. Hope this helps."
1,"I've been lucky enough in life to never have  been on either side of infidelity so far ..unless I'm completly oblivious ,  which I don't think I am. Anyway , one sure sign of someone being unfaithful to me would be that he would be missing a limb or be seriously seriously  wounded in some way.  There's your sign."
0,Always lying and getting caught.
1,He makes up excuses and works later ours but is really with some other girl.
1,Everyone gave you some wonderful answers how ever I want to add in that a lot of times you DO get a gut feeling. Just you gotta make sure that it is not FEAR that you think it is a gut feeling......

1,"Pigmentation is discoloring of the skin that usually occurs when the skin has been exposed to the sun and has been damaged. Freckles, age spots and other discoloration are the most common forms of skin pigmentation. Some people are born with freckles while others develop them as they age and have been exposed to the sun.
Age spots, also known as liver spots, and other pigmentation issues can be reduced although you should always consult your doctor before trying to fade them. You can purchase over-the-counter exfoliating products containing alpha hydroxyl that can be used on the hands, face, arms, legs, chest and shoulders to reduce pigmentation marks. These exfoliators should be used at night time and they remove dead skin cells to reveal the unpigmented skin after regular use.
There are also daily exfoliators that you can use during the day in conjunction with sun block to help protect your skin. Both the night and day exfoliation process takes a few weeks to work. You may notice fast results if the pigmentation you are trying to fade is light.
Some people prefer to use natural bleachers on their skin such as vitamin C and lemon juice. You would apply both to the area you wish to fade.  Vitamin C also helps protect your skin and it may help reduce ageing signs by regenerating and tightening the skin.
Always test products on an area of skin that is less visible to ensure that you do not get a rash or other irritation from it. When going out in the sun, wear a hat, sunglasses and sun block to protect your skin from developing other pigmentation problems. If you have any problems with any over-the-counter products, discontinue use and see your doctor right away. He or she may have a product that is better for your particular needs."
0,"I hate looking into the mirror because of my dark patches on my cheeks. I've had this ugly problem since 8 years. I've tried everything possible but nothing seems to work. Please help!!!!
What is the most effective way without having any side effects?"
1,"There are two definitions of pigmentation.
1-Natural Color (of plants and animals)
2-Discoloration (abnormal coloring in plants or animals because of a disease).
You should apply a few skin lightening products and also, keep yourself protected from the sun. The sun will further darken discolored areas. Hydroquinone Night Cream is very effective in pigmentation."
1,"Pigmentation is basically just the colouring of the skin. If you are wanting to remove pigmentation and have a lighter complexion, especially for specific areas of darker pigmentation, there are products (mainly creams) that you can use to reduce this, e.g. - this one here. The other option is laser treatment, but that is normally used for more specific blemishes and smaller areas of abnormal pigmention (that is, abnormal to the majority of your skin colour).

Try having a look around online for more products and maybe even go into a couple of stores to test whats best.

In my opinion however, with skin being the largest organ of your body, it's not something that should be mucked around with. If your skin is healthy, regardless of the colour, I reckon you should count your blessings and give yourself a hug."

1,"PAV is an acronym for Pre Accident Value.
 

Pre accident value is an important concept for salvage firms. They buy damaged vehicles and either strip them for parts to sell or repair them to sell them as a functioning machine. PAV in relation to the cost of salvage determines whether the firm will carry out the work at all.
Some cars are so badly damaged that the money spent on collection and development of parts could be greater than any profit that could be made. Other vehicles will have parts that can be salvaged and sold for more than the cost of salvaging them. This work will be taken on by the firm.
PAV is what the firm will be looking at when determining whether to take on the work. If the pre accident value of a car is $5,000 then they will use an approximation to calculate the value of that car in a repaired state. In this case, let's say it's $3,000. They then assess how much it will cost them to repair the car. If this figure is considerably less than $3,000 they will take the job on. If the figure is less then they will calculate the cost of removing the car's valuable parts. Let's say the labor will cost $1,000 in this case. Now they will only take this job on if they believe the components will sell for a combined total of more than $1,000.
In the insurance industry, PAC is important because the insurer will pay out for repair or replacement of a damaged car based on the condition it was in when the cover was bought by the customer. If the PAC value is $5,000 and the car is too badly damaged for repair, it may only then be worth $500 for scrap. However, the insurance firm will give the customer $5,000 so that he can replace the car."
1,Pre-Accident Value.
1,PAV is of great use to insurance companies instead of being essential for individuals to take note of. It is in short the excess value in which a car holds to determine whether or not there is still any chance to resell the vehicle after it has met with an accident or to simply be sent for scrap.
0,"Age of the car is a very important aspect which
decides the resale value. With increasing age the resale value of the car
undergoes depreciation. The distance travelled by the car is another important
parameter price determination while you sell your car. The value of a second hand car decreases with the increase in the
number of kilometers travelled."
0,"Its not so easy question, and that's why I'll advise you better go to this website www.americaninsurance.com/ for example and find out there more information about that."
0,"Whiplash syndrome can be a complicated
condition to diagnose. It can be caused whenever someone is involved in a car
accident with speeds as little as fifteen miles per hour, even if the parties
involved were wearing a seatbelt. The condition can also be complicated to
diagnose because the symptoms do not always show up right away. The person can
experience pain in the neck immediately after the trauma or not for several
hours, several days or up to two weeks. All of these situations can constitute
whiplash but the more severe cases show up right away.
As soon as you are injured and suspect a
whiplash injury, get a diagnosis from an emergency room physician, a
chiropractor or a regular doctor. A diagnosis is important to your car accident compensation solicitors because they need to see your medical records and diagnostic information in order to help decide if you have whiplash, if there
was another negligent party and how much to file a compensation claim for.
Whiplash diagnoses can be hidden in obscure diagnoses like cervical strain,
cervical sprain or flexion extension injury to the neck. Make sure your car
accident compensation solicitors have the right diagnosis when dealing with
your claim.
When you are injured with suspected
whiplash injuries, you need to assess the degree of your symptoms. If you have
severe symptoms, make sure you keep your head completely still until the
emergency medical services or EMS arrives. They will put you into a cervical
collar and a long spine board and will transport you by ambulance to the
nearest emergency room. There you will be seen by an emergency room physician.
In mild cases, the doctor skips doing an
immediate x-ray. He or she will feel all the muscles of the neck and shoulders
for stiffness, swelling and tenderness. The doctor will look for abrasions,
cuts and bruising. You’ll often see an abrasion or bruising on the shoulder and
upper chest because of the seat belt or because of an airbag injury.
The doctor may remove the cervical collar
and, if there is minimal tenderness of the back of the neck, he or she will
check the range of motion of the neck, both passively and actively. In other
words, he or she will move your neck around without your help to see how stiff
it is and will then ask you to tip your head forward, backward, side to side
and have you twist the neck. He or she will ask you to squeeze their fingers to
check to make sure your upper extremity strength is good and will have you move
your legs against resistance in case there is a problem with your lower
extremity strength. Sensation of your body will be tested, sometimes by poking
the skin with a sharp object to see if you have sensation. Your deep tendon
reflexes (in your ankles, knees, wrists and elbows) will be checked to see if
they are normal.
Doctors who are suspicious of a more
serious injury will begin by ordering a plain film of the neck from the front
and side. If these are normal, many doctors will remove the cervical collar and
allow you to move your neck about. If there is still a suspicion of a more
serious injury, such as a cervical cord injury or fracture to the cervical
spine, the doctor will do further testing, such as a CT scan (computerized
tomography) or MRI scan (magnetic resonance imaging), in order to get a better
look at the neck, including the muscles. An MRI exam will outline the muscles
better than a CT scan, which will need contrast to outline the spinal cord.
If there is any question of nerve damage,
the doctor might go on to order an EMG or electromyogram. This is a nerve
conduction test that tells if there are any pinched nerves involved or damage
to any peripheral nerve. This could mean that swollen muscles, tendons or
ligaments are impinging on nerves and affecting the function of the nerve.
Most people take about two weeks to recover
their whiplash symptoms so they feel normal. The rest recover over several
months to a year. About 18 percent of people still have symptoms after two
years and are considered to have chronic symptoms. Let your car accident
compensation solicitor know if you have chronic symptoms because this will
affect the amount of the compensation claim you receive. Chronic symptoms will
generally pay more money than symptoms which eventually resolve.
If your symptoms last longer than two weeks
or are considered severe, you may be referred to a physiatrist or to a physical
therapist. A physiatrist is a doctor that is trained in the way the body moves,
especially after injury. A physical therapist is specially trained to evaluate
and treat musculoskeletal injuries like whiplash injuries.
These professionals will re-evaluate you.
They will examine your active and passive range of motion to see how strong the
neck is and how stiff it might be. Your range of motion includes forward
movement, backward movement, sideways tilt and rotational motion of your neck.
They will also assess your strength (in your arms, legs and trunk), your
sensation (in all parts of the body) and your deep tendon reflexes. Any
abnormalities will be noted on your record before the professional begins
treatment.
Treatment often begins with deep tissue
massage using electrical stimulation or hand work. Then the practitioner works
to increase the range of motion of the neck in all directions, focusing
especially on the trouble spots. The practitioner can do things like pressure
point work that puts deep pressure on a small area of a muscle and allows the
muscle to “release” and be less tense. Strengthening exercises are done to get
your muscle tone back in a more normal way and things like ice and heat are
used to relieve inflammation. In more serious cases, a physiatrist might inject
a muscle with hydrocortisone fluid in order to break down the inflammation in
that particular muscle. That sort of treatment helps but is rarely done because
whiplash involves such a large area of the neck."
1,"If you want to burn videos to a DVD the first thing you need to check is that your computer has a DVD-RW drive. Most modern computers do, unless you have a netbook (one of the smaller laptops which don't have CD/DVD drives).
Next you will need to download some DVD burning software. There are lots of different options out there, but they all do pretty much the same thing, and you shouldn't need to pay for it, the free ones should do everything you need.
I have a mac, and use iDVD as it integrates nicely with iTunes, iPhoto etc.
If you have a Windows machine, a good one is ImgBurn, which again is free, and really easy to use.
""How"" you actually do it will depend on which software you have, but it is usually as straight forward as selecting the file you want to burn and clicking Go.
There will be different options in terms of quality and file type, I wouldn't worry about this too much unless you are very concerned with the movie looking incredible when you play it on your TV.
To be honest, if you want to burn a movie on to one standard DVD, you aren't going to get HD quality anyway. 
If high definition is what you want, then I would advise buying the film on Blu-Ray, but if you're okay with ""pretty good quality"", then you won't be disappointed by your burnt dvd."
1,"I'm the one who asked this.
This is the backstory:
So we all work together. Let's call my crush Adam, and his friend Jerry. They're both 18. And I'm 22. Jerry and I were playing a game called ""marry, sleep with, and kill"". It's a game where the person gives you three people's names (we used people that we work with) and you pick who you would marry, sleep with or kill. And it EVERY single time that he would give me the three names, he would almost always include Adam. Then later on, me and Jerry were throwing out trash together and Jerry said something about a new manager that just started. And I admitted that the new manager was pretty attractive. He started laughing and then asked me to rank the guys who work here. I started off with the cute new manager, then when I was around 3rd place, Jerry was like, ""3rd is my friend Adam?"" 

Later on, a customer hit on me while me and Jerry were on break. And I turned him down. I later told Jerry it was because the customer was too old for me and my limit was 20 years old to 27. Then Jerry said ""No. It's 18 to 27"". 

Does Jerry know I like Adam? Or did Adam say anything about me to Jerry? I don't think I've made it Obvious that I like Adam.
Also. On two occasions, Adam stood really close to me. Like, I could feel his chest on my shoulder. And on one of those occasions, I had my hand on a cooking tray (were both cooks) and he put his hand over mine and left it there until I said something about it. He had also volunteered to help me take out the trash, but they ended up sending him to do something else. And Jerry ended up helping me."

If there's no trust there's no relationship.

1,Der I don't know if you don't know but maybe she went swimming in the river.
1,"Based on the circumstances you've described, I can see why you'd have suspicions.

Whilst the signs that she's cheating might be there, though, I wouldn't jump to conclusions just yet.

I would recommend sitting down and talking to your girlfriend frankly.

My girlfriend comes home with wet knickers The first issue to address is her wet underwear.

As I'm sure you're aware, there are a number of reasons why a woman's undergarments might be wet.

Yes, sexual excitement or activity does cause females to produce natural lubricants down below - but the dampness in her underwear could also be down to:

urine
menstruation
the vagina naturally cleaning itself out (this might also cause a white discharge)
sweating
infection
Just thinking about it for a second, it'd make sense that your partner might be too embarrassed to tell you that one of the above was the cause of her dampness.

My girlfriend comes home with bruises on her thighs

If your girlfriend has bruises on her thighs, it can be easy to assume that she's been having rough sex with some stranger behind your back.

But before you start thinking the worst, take some time to consider the following:

She may have fallen and injured herself
She many have been sexually assaulted
As far as sexual assault goes, it is very possible that your girlfriend might not want divulge that kind of information to you straight away.

Before you go accusing her of infidelity, I'd make 100% sure that she hasn't been raped or seriously sexually-assaulted.

How would you feel if something like that happened to you, and then you came home and were accused of cheating?

As far as infidelity goes, you'll never know unless you either catch her in the act - or she confesses.

So, the only real way you'll know is by letting her do her thing and following her - or you could try sitting and talking to her like an adult."
1,"I think there's something she's not telling you, but don't push her."
1,I agree with Kazza1994. Although there is probably a very logical reason for her to come home in that state. You might just be jumping to conclusions. Just let her know you are there for her.
1,I think she may have been assaulted and is afraid to tell anyone.  Most rapes are not reported.  You should just let her know you're there for her.
1,You need to know if he or she really cheats  so you can be certain about your thoughts.  You contact Smith via his gmail account( Williamsdhackghost at gmail..com) i'm sure he'd help

1,Why don't you ask her why she muted herself? You won't know until you ask her and then you can determine if she is telling the truth. Don't place more significance on it until you ask her about it.

Later on, a customer hit on me while me and Jerry were on break. And I turned him down. I later told Jerry it was because the customer was too old for me and my limit was 20 years old to 27. Then Jerry said ""No. It's 18 to 27"". 

Does Jerry know I like Adam? Or did Adam say anything about me to Jerry? I don't think I've made it Obvious that I like Adam.
Also. On two occasions, Adam stood really close to me. Like, I could feel his chest on my shoulder. And on one of those occasions, I had my hand on a cooking tray (were both cooks) and he put his hand over mine and left it there until I said something about it. He had also volunteered to help me take out the trash, but they ended up sending him to do something else. And Jerry ended up helping me."
1,"I’m the worst at writing. It’s not the grammar and everything, but I definitely can’t write a good essay, no matter how hard I try.
However, when it comes to math, it entirely depends on how good my teacher is. If explained correctly, I’m able to memorize the process and apply it easily. Same goes for history and science."
1,"I am doing pretty well in all my subjects right now, but I'm most interested in math and science, so analyzing poetry and literature isn't really my thing. I can easily write a lab report, but writing an essay about a poem is a bit harder for me."

1,"Common feelings after a break up
After a break-up, it is likely that it will take you both some time to move on. Feelings don't just stop overnight, and it is likely that you both feel a degree of confusion.

Of course, it can depend on how long you have been dating for, but many people say that it takes a month for every year you were together for the feelings to subside.

Many of the things involved with being in a relationship become habits, and many people find that these are what they miss the most after a separation. However, with this can come the freedom of doing things that you enjoy again, or getting in touch with old friends with whom you had lost touch.

But how do I know if my ex still has feelings for me?
I assume you're asking this question as you still have feelings for your ex yourself. If your break-up is quite recent, the answer is probably that he or she does still have feelings for you - but that doesn't mean that they are necessarily the sort of feelings that are conducive to getting back together.

It might just be that your ex still feels physically-attracted to you, and many people find that this can be the hardest part of the relationship to get over. Normally, people only truly move on when one of them meets someone else and starts a new physical relationship.

The main way to tell if your ex is still thinking about you, is if he or she finds ways to talk to you or text you, maybe about something totally irrelevant, just to have some communication with you. This should be treated as them 'keeping their foot in the door', which you might want to go along with, if there is any chance of you getting back together.

Other signs that your ex has feelings for you could be that he or she turns up in places where you always go, or starts making friends with your friends in a bid to know what you're doing and whether you have someone new in your life yet.

What does it mean if my ex still has feelings for me?
It means that they haven't totally moved on, but it might not mean that they want to start up the relationship again. Sometimes, people love each other but, because of other circumstances (like distance, or family commitments) they break up, and then the feelings definitely don't go straight away.

Because of the emotions involved, some people find that a clear break-up with no communication is much simpler and cleaner, and causes less pain in the long-term.

The majority of people would say that it is virtually impossible to stay friends with your ex, especially if both of you still have feelings for each other, or doubts about whether you should have broken up in the first place."
1,"How do I know if my ex still has feelings for me? He still hugs me.

I'm in the same situation. I still care about him and there is a part of me that still loves him too.

After we broke up he sent me a message saying he will still love me and still think about me, but when we are at school we act like we don't know each other and it hurts. I want to talk to him but I can't and it sucks I want us to be at least friends."
1,"I can relate to your situation. If you care about someone, and it doesn't work out, there is nothing wrong with still caring about them. People say I'm stupid for still loving my ex, but just because I love her doesn't mean she will ever get or even deserves my heart again. But there is nothing wrong with at least being friends, if you can.

I would call him up or e-mail him and ask him some questions. I would recommend e-mail if he has one, because for some reason people always seem to talk more freely through e-mail.

Anyway, good luck."
1,"I think my ex still has feelngs for me, he hugs me and he always knows how to make me smile. He seeks for attention but I think being friends the only way things get better, but if you want to get back with your ex it's okay, but just think before you do it."
1,"I can totally relate. I may only be 14, but I went out with this boy, and we broke up about a year and a half ago. He's exactly the same. We were complete opposites, and now we don't ever look at each other.

I think that he thinks it's still awkward and he wants to leave it a little longer between you so that you can both have you own space and slowly become friends again. Maybe not best friends but at least friends."
1,"Well, mine broke up with me about a month ago. Since then he was texting me and still seeing me. I was thinking he was getting better and thinking about going back out with me again until he got back from his holiday and started seeing someone else.

He claimed that he didn't love me any more. It's just that we had a pretty strong relationship that lasted 18 months and in the end it only took him a month to move on after 'he'd been playing with words'.

What I really wonder now is that if he really loved me when we were in a relationship, because it didn't take him very long to get over me. It's even worse that I may have said something over Twitter and that caused him to have a go at me and say that he doesn't care, which I then calmly explained and that he said it would taken a long time to forgive.

The hardest part is watching him behave in the same way to her as he did with me - you don't feel special anymore. He acts like we didn't have anything together, but we did."
0,"So many answers on this page miss the obvious: why don't you just sit down and talk to him about it? You were in a relationship together once, can't you at least have a truthful conversation anymore?
Just look into his eyes and ask him and you will know before he even says a word"
1,"I can relate.... I and my boyfriend have been dating for four months,,,and I've broke up for a reason that I was not understanding according to him...he once in anger proposed his best friend whom i envied coz i felt she took my place....he promised he would tell her the truth but started falling for her for a silly reson that I didn't undrstand,,,,
How am I to understand wen he didn't tell this gsl the truth...it was very difficult for me take that he is now with someone else"

1,This has happend to me. What I did was I went up to him and asked him.
1,"Don't think about it. Think about ""Is he the best for me?"", ""Can i get someone better?"" (don't think pessimistically). If he still likes you, he could probably stare at you still from a distance, and blush when his friends tease him about you !"
1,Unfortunately you can't. Take everything they say with a pinch of salt if they are strangers.
1,You would never no but it is very unsafe for you to me text someone you don't no a lot of ppl ask me for my cell phone number but I just say I don't have one
1,"Lying tends to cause physical tells to arise, little unncessary signals that arise, such as twitches, changes of eye direction and scratching, biting the lip or other some such things.

If you look into someone's eyes, they will tend to look to their right when they are remembering or being honest and they will tend to access their creativity by looking up and left or simply left when lying.

Liars tend to blink more, don't know why, perhaps it's the pressure.

A forced smile does not engage the entire face, it's simply moving the muscles of the mouth. A real smile is emotionally engaged and muscles of the entire face come into play.

Someone avoiding the question is often telling the truth, but only because then they don't have to lie. For instance, Did you steal the ring? I've got plenty of money. Or Did you see it happen? I'm just minding my own business."
1,"As already stated, look right into someones eyes as if you are truly interested in what he or she is saying.   Don't let them know in any way, you are wondering if they are lying.   Also, if someone gives TOO much detail, better wonder why.   Are they lying or hiding something."
1,Their eyes will start to move to the left
1,"I agree it makes him look guilty but he may not be.  I would talk to him about it and find outs what's going on.you can also find what site he is looking at and sign up under a fake name, and then you can catch I'm red handed. My friends wife did this and he got busted. Good luck I hope this helps"
1,"Wow. Deleting the history from the computer makes him look guilty. This doesn't necessary mean he is cheating; he could have some type of fetish he is ashamed of that anonymous women cater to. Best bet would be to discuss the issue calmly and let him know you're willing to spice up the relationship. If that does not work, you may have a bigger problem on your hands."

1,"There is a website that will give you step-by-step guides to hacking into accounts, especially social networking sites like MySpace, Facebook and Tagged. This website is www.lameass.com. It is not advisable to hack into accounts, though, as it is not ethical and is also illegal.

Tagged is a social networking site that was launched in 2004. Users can register for free and can then customise their profile page by uploading photographs, posting information about their interests and posting status updates. The site contains visual chat rooms, and enables users to send ""winks"" to each other.

Tagged was named as the most annoying website in 2009 by Time Magazine. This was largely due to the fact that e-mails were sent to large numbers of people who were not registered on Tagged to try and encourage them to join the site. Andrew Cuomo, the New York State Attorney General decided to sue Tagged in 2009 due to this marketing strategy and the case was settled with Tagged agreeing to pay $500,000 and promising to change their marketing strategies.

Tagged currently has an estimated 6 million US users and over 20 million users worldwide. One country where Tagged is no longer available is Qatar, who blocked the site due to them not being able to filter what they classed as ""inappropriate content”. There are some concerns in that the site shows user e-mail addresses and the site is very popular with teens. The demographic of the site seems to be shifting, though, as the age group with the most Tagged users is now the 35-49 age group.

When signing up for Tagged, the site says it will e-mail you about new users on the site. As a site Tagged is very similar in appearance to Facebook."

1,"Mercy killing is defined as the killing of one person by another. The victim of mercy killing is normally in the vegetable state or has an injury or illness that cannot be cured, as it is usually in its last stage. The victim experiences immensely painful last days just before his or her death. For a voluntary case of mercy killing to take place, the killer must first obtain the consent of the victim, but there have been recorded cases of mercy killing against the wishes of the victim as well.

This is known as involuntary mercy killing. Mercy killing is known as euthanasia. The victim of a mercy killing dies a painless death after suffering an incurable ailment or serious injury. The term euthanasia, which means mercy killing, is derived from the Greek word for 'good death'. Euthanasia has been legalised in some Western countries but is still considered to be an unethical practice in the Third World."
1,"Mercy killing should NOT be legal. Not because jesus or god or whatever gave us life, but because we as human being are corrupt, we can never have a legalized say over the existence of another life, even if it is given.  On a whole killing is recognized as wrong, suicide is recognized as wrong, and the making of death to be friendlier, easier, more comfortable is wrong. If there are those in pain, let them be euthanized, but let it be done in secret. Some doctors are willing to do this. But this should not be a well versed option, it then poses too much a threat to be abused."
0,"Mercy Killing
Definition:

1. Euthanasia:
An easy or painless death, or the intentional ending of the life of a person suffering from an incurable or painful disease at his or her request. The intentional termination of the life of one human being by another.

OR

The intentional killing by act or omission of a dependent human being for his or her alleged benefit. The key word here is ""intentional"". If death is not intended, it is not an act of euthanasia."
1,"Mercy killing is the choice of the individual and it should be universally recognized as such! It is heinous to suggest that because someone else disagrees with the voluntary ending of your life you have to suffer intolerable pain! How would you feel if you were lying in a hospital bed; struggling to breath and in terrible pain from an incurable cancer, wanting only to end it and somebody told you you were only allowed to die if the cancer decided to kill you some time soon? I'd be infuriated and seek to end my own life in some way anyway if I could not end the lives of the cowards who kept me suffering pointlessly because of their weak stomachs. Just because the rest of society has not come to terms with death does not mean that people who are dying of chronic illness or even the effects of life itself should have to suffer from that selfish ignorance."
1,I think mercy-killing is not the solution to get rid of patience.because it is a kind of crime.I am a muslim and believe in God.so it is illegal action.not because I am a muslim to say it is illegal.it is not humanity to kill someone who is suffering from pain.if we kill someone so what is humanity or what is your definition of humanity.God give us this opportunity to live in this world and only God decided whether we live or die.life is a gift from God to us.
1,"I feel that helping a patient from incurable and painful disease by mercy killing is right.If he is living with pain and problems,atleast he can die peacfully."
1,"Mercy killing should definitely NOT be legal. NO human can just decide who has to die, it is the patients wish to die. There might be a chance that the tremendously ill person might be able to get well later, miracles do happen!"
0,"What about the person that wants to end thier life and has thought about it for many years but does not want to make a mess of it! Because if they do mess up ie overdose that leaves them blind deaf paraplegic etc and end up being even more of a burden on thier friends and family? Not to mention the cost to the service's (doctors, nurses, surgeons, ambulance paramedics, police etc, when most of these service's could be helping those with awful illnesses that really desperately want hold on to life!  Also how many other people then have to be involved, if you jump over a cliff or stand on train lines or drive head on into a wall or shoot your self in the head or cut your wrists etc etc etc! It involves so so many other service's and its usually a MESS! It goes on every day. Some of these people have thought about this for years and all they really want is a peaceful exit from the sadness. I would like compassionate help and a safe way of your own decision to leave this life if that is what one wants to do."
1,Mercy killing is the killing of one who is in pain or suffering of some sort
1,"Mercy is the term used when one person kills another to relief the victim from futher suffering. Such as someone who is in cronic incurable pain and pleeds for their own death. The first ones could go back to biblical times,say someone badly injuried in battle would be put out of suffering by a fellow soldier."
1,In my view mercy killing is helpful for a person who was suffering with an incurable problem. But it should be a legal. That means with the permission of the victim you should apply this mercy killing.
1,Mercy killing should be allowed only when the disease is incurable and after doctors have tried their level best to cure them. Again it should be with the consent of the patient. Involuntary and non-voluntary mercy killing should be strictly prohibited. Only voluntary mercy killing should be legalized but various conditions should be there.
1,"It is good, the fellow is going to die, sooner or later. Make thing settle faster, may be good to all. Provided the family member allow it and where the patient totally don't have the ability to think and talk anymore.
But make sure it is not a killing with bad purpose and make Euthanasia as a excuse to kill others."
1,Killing a suffering person
1,To set a person free from his sufferings and it should be legal.
1,The life is a gift from God nobody else is allowed to end this life
1,"I think it should be legalised, because everyone  wants to live a peaceful life
it should be better to kill the person who lives stressfull life"
1,Killing of one person by another is called mercy killing.It should not be illegal.In my point of view the person who involve in this mercy killing he is the worst person in the world and I think he don't know about humanity.We are the human beings not animals.Born like a human being is a great one.
1,"Mercy killing is not right. Whether or not you have the persons consent, isn't suicide a horrible image in your head? Euthanasia is defined as helping someone die. Couldn't that be considered a murder? How would it feel to have to deal with the fact that you assisted in the DEATH of a friend. Someone referenced Of Mice and Men earlier. Wouldn't George feel terrible about the act he committed to his one true friend? He has to live with that for the rest of his life! That could just lead him to end his life in the same way. Mercy killing is NOT the answer."

1,Killing a suffering person
1,A practice that enables a person to kill another person who is suffering from something and can't help themselves anymore. Whether is right or wrong is own choice. In part is considered to be right because when you can't help yourself to have a normal life or when you are at a hospital knowing that you have a limited life or that you too old that can't even serve yourself you would desire to end it quick. For other people is like just killing itself and shouldnt be allowed. It's a really controversial topic.
1,Mercy killing is to kill somebody that is suffering..suffering very bad..they might have injury's very painful and it can't be solve...so what I think about that mercy killing situation is to be illegal in the whole world ..a lot of people suffer just for seeing other people suffering..so the good thing to do to those people or animals is to kill them illegal.doing a mercy killing .where ever they going.... They going to a better place and they wont suffer ..... So mercy killing is a crime??or a illegal crime?

The first one in the list is probably the best one for blogs with over 3,000 pages. If you have more then 3K pages then you will need to go with the Paid version of the tool.

1,"Downloading music from YouTube is very easy if you know what to do. However, if you support the music industry and the artist or band who made the song then it would be much better of you to buy the CD or purchase and download the album from an online store such as iTunes.

However if you wish to download the music directly from YouTube then all you need to do is open up YouTube and search for the song that you want to download. Make sure that you find a version of the song that is clear or high quality, preferably not the music video as a lot of music videos contain scenes or noises that aren't on the official song. Preferably you should choose one that someone else has made which shows the lyrics.

Then what you need to do is to open a separate window and perform a Google search for 'YouTube to mp3'. Open up this page and then go back to YouTube. Copy the address bar that is at the top of the page and then paste it into the YouTube convertor and press convert. Once it has converted download the file directly onto your computer.

Once the download is complete, insert your USB into your computer and then open up the folder. Look in your download page to locate the files that you have just downloaded and then drag and drop them into your USB folder. However if you wish to keep a copy of the music file on your computer then you should just copy and paste them into the USB file.

If you are transferring the files to another computer then all you need to do is insert your USB stick into the computer, open the folder and then copy and paste them across into a file on the computer."

In this legal aspect it is a contract whereby one person agrees to indemnify another against a loss which may happen or to pay a sum of money to him on the occurring of a particular event. All contracts of insurance (except marine insurance) may be verbal or in waiting; but practically contracts of assurance are included in a document.

Some principles of insurance: The following are the basic essentials or requirements of insurance concerned.
1. Utmost good faith. All types of contracts of insurance depends the contracts of utmost good faith. Both parties (insurer and the insured) in the contract must disclose all material facts for the benefit of each other.

2. Insurable interest. The insured must possess an insurable interest in the object insured. It may be defined as a financial interest in the subject matter of contract. The presence of insurable interest is a legal requirement. So an insurance contract without the existence of insurable interest is not legally valid and cannot be claimed in a Court. The object of this principle is to prevent insurance from becoming a gambling contract."

1,"Like everyone else I get depressed after xmas but then after a couple of weeks the same old routine kicks in and its all forgotten, but this year I can't stop thinking about xmas I have been planning for this years since early jan!! I often just get bored so come on the computer and look at xmas websites, which is how I got here. At first I thought I was being silly and then I wondered if I should talk to someone about it, but then I realised I just love it so much for all the right reasons family, friends, the films, the decorations, the sense that everyone is just that bit happier and more polite, a sense of magic in the air, presents, the food, the magic and sense the world gets a little bit better. Then I remembered what tiny tim said in scrooge about keeping christmas well all year, maybe if we all did we would all just be that bit happier and polite and get back some of that magic lost as a child"
1,"After every Xmas night, I lay in my bed and tears come dripping down my face. Every year the same thoughts go through my head, where has the time gone? All my family is getting so old and big. I look back and remember the tears running down my fathers eyes when we gather around the table on Xmas eve. I remember the glassy eyes that appear on my uncles face when my young cousins open their gifts with such joy. I cry thinking about my grandfathers beautiful tears that drip down his face when his granddaughter gives him a five dollar bill for Xmas. These are the things you must love. For some it may be the gifts, but as you get older, you realize that the family is so much more important than the gifts you receive from Santa. Jesus was born in Xmas day. We celebrate him being our savior. When I look back on the past two days on Xmas night, I remember the great joy everybody had and the love that was in the house. I see my divorced uncle s tears in his eyes when he watches his beautiful children open their gifts. Thank you Jesus. Happy birthday."
1,It always happens when ever we are with our with our family and friends and celebrate something .We enjoy alt at that time after that time is over we miss that moment and feel so lonely .
1,"Our tree is still up...no kidding. It's coming down tomorrow finally. I always get sad when it ends because it's one last Christmas when my kids are 6 and 9. Next year they will be 7 and 10. Christmas is precious when your kids are young so the way I see it, when it ends, then it's one less Christmas for this stage in their lives. This is the first year in years that I don't feel so sad and I think it's because we are so busy, there was some illness during the holidays and because I have many plans for the immediate future. It's flown by."
1,"Christmas is a hectic time. There's the stress of choosing and buying presents for friends and family, and it's that time of year when all the family get together, so when January approaches and its time for everyone to go home and get back to work, the house will seem very quiet. You're probably feeling depressed because it's all over and you have to settle in at work again.

Winter also begins around Christmas, so you may be feeling depressed because the weather is miserable. Also, the act of taking down Christmas decorations can make people feel depressed. Perhaps you are feeling depressed because a new year has started and you feel lost because Christmas is over.

On the plus side though, you have the January sales to look forward too! Also, if you've made a new year's resolution and you stick to it, then you will feel better and as though you have achieved something."
1,I'm alone and everyone's grown! So I miss them a lot!
1,I feel exactly the same but its because all the family are happy and in a festive mood and it wont be the same for another year
1,Cause I love every second of christmas morning unwrapping presents and then when its over I realize that went by too fast it wasnt long enough. For me time flies during christmas day and christmas eve and when its over I get all sad. If I hear a christmas song at the beginning of january I break down
1,"Maybe because in these days you feel more close to your family or love ones, and when it finished, everyone goes back to a normal life and you still need them to feel OK."
1,I think it is due to the excitement and energy of the season finally being over. A person can feel relieved that another holiday has passed but at the same time they may feel saddened that it is actually gone and not to return for another whole year.
1,I feel the same way. Like I just thought about Christmas right now and I'm starting to feel depressed. I love that time of year. 6 months away. :[
1,"I feel more depressed in the weeks leading up to Christmas. People stressing over buying the perfect gift. Stores with Santa and reindeer pictures blaring songs about mommy kissing Santa Claus, while they try to convince you to spend money. The general idea that Christmas and happiness lie in getting gifts, and the general madness that have become modern corperate 'Christmas'. What is forgotten is peace. Peace brought through a small child, said to be born of a virgin. Peace brought through a small child, who many believed fulfilled promises made by God to His people. Peace brought through a small child, who after living a phenomenal life, was crucified, died, and was entombed... Yet who many believe rose again from the dead so that we might all have true peace with the God who made us. I feel depressed because people often miss the hope that this season reminds us of."
1,Because you love christmas. It is a time of good cheer when everyone is so happy and festive. And of course there are all the wonderful traditions that only happen at christmas time. After it is all over you have to wait a whole year for it to happen again.
1,"It's like one of Newton's laws that for every action there is an equal, opposite reaction. After all the excitement, fussing, and fun, it all comes to an abrupt end. What goes up must come down so to speak. But now you get to play with all the new toys you got for Christmas. Cheer up!"
1,You feel that way because you don't get any more presents
1,I don't know. I feel more re leaved.
1,Christmas is when you have fun with all of your relatives and drink lots of eggnog. You might be hung-over or you might be home sick or even the you might be feeling down is because you never got that present that you REALLY wanted.

1,Because leading up to christmas is always the exciting bit but when christmas is here it seems to be like its just over
0,"READ THIS AND DON'T LET CHRISTMAS END--IT'LL END
ANY DEPRESSION YOU FEEL NOW!!!because you're like me..you like the cheeriness of and closeness of being with your family and friends at a time that bonds everyone ..the shopping for loved ones is so cool..wasn't it a head rush to look for stuff to buy for mom and dad and friends? Walking around the store knowing what they would wouldn't(probably) like to recieve on christmas day? It's  a very emotionally happy sensation that lingers in your head for two months before christmas,thinking about the possible gifts that family and friends would wind up buying for you and then there's the decorating of the tree and the lights that need to be put on the windows or on the balcony and not to mention the cheeriness of the christmas conversations that go on  all november and december..talking about gifts,conversing about the right place for the tree, and I can't even begin to explain why you'd miss christmas after it's over..I only covered a tiny tiny bit of it all.it doesn't have to end.I 've decide to buy my parents inexpensive stuff a couple times a week at the dollar stores here in town..also the thrift stores..I'm talking about inexpensive ,not expensive..dollar stuff..(maybe 2 or 3 dollars)..a scented candle  here and there,a coffee mug from the 99 cents only store,etc..buying  stuff like that for parents or friends or for who'mevr you choose,a couple times a week or more.. Can literally keep enough of that christmas spirit alive that you won't miss christmas all year long..the really neat part of it..wrap the items you buy in wrapping paper ,just as though it's still christmas...either hand the gifts directly to who'mever your giving them to or  secretly leave them in a place in  their house where they'll be sure to find them after you leave..don't let christmas end.keep it alive  all year into the  christmas season of 2010, in an inexpensive but postive way!! I am!!

Good luck!!!!"
1,As you have to wait until November until the build up starts again.
1,"Because when Christmas is over you don't get any more cool stuff, if you even got the cool stuff that you wanted. You have to go back to work, and work all year long just to pay for all the cool stuff you bought for everyone, only to do it all over again."
1,In the last week I've been feeling really depressed but perhaps as soon as we are more into january I will start to feel better.
1,"You are sad cause the excitement is Over for this year as your kids/family leaves. I am just the opposite. I have a small family...only men are living and then there is my daughter and me. Quite frankly, our life is extremely busy and we are finally off for 2 or 3 days and we want to be ALONE. We do not want to be disturbed by their needs and wanting somewhere to eat. If they are invited, we grill blackened filet mignon and they gripe cause it is NOT Turkey. Well, even if I had all day, I will not cook a meal for 4 hours and within 20 mins, it is eaten. I am just happier alone or with the neighbors AFTER their kids have left.Now, once my daughter is married, I realize my attitude may have to change. But then I will be willing to fly, help and converse with in-laws. But I will be retired by then and will WANT to do it. Wanting makes all of the difference!! Lol"

1,"The answer to the question of whether or not you have to pay tax on an IRA (Individual Retirement Account) withdrawal once you’re over the age of 60 partly rests on what kind of IRA you have, a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. Only a Roth IRA offers the option of a tax-free withdrawal, an age over 60 being one of the requirements.

A traditional IRA has strict eligibility requirements, and every withdrawal from a traditional IRA is subject to federal income tax. The traditional IRA contrasts with the Roth IRA, which offers what are called qualified withdrawals.

As long as you’ve had your Roth IRA for at least five years, which is the other requirement for a qualified withdrawal, you do not have to pay tax on a withdrawal from it once you’re over the age of 60. This is one of the main advantages that a Roth IRA has over a traditional IRA.

Another difference between a traditional IRA and a Roth IRA is that contributions to a traditional IRA can be tax deductible, whereas contributions to a Roth IRA can never be tax deductible.

If you’re not over 60, or if you have not had the IRA for at least five years, the amount of tax paid on a withdrawal from either a Roth IRA (as well as a traditional IRA) can be as high as 20 percent.

If you’re looking for withdrawals that are not subject to federal income tax, then you want a Roth IRA. Just know that you can’t deduct any contributions to a Roth IRA from your income tax."

Find the instructions for the 2007 Form 1040, got to pages 21 ans 22.  If you made non-deductible contributions to your IRA over the years, it's possible there could be no tax on the withdrawal.  You should have a copy of your last Form 8606 (Non-Taxable IRA Contributions) which will show your total basis of non-taxable contributions over the years.  With that you will be able to compute what part of the $10,000, if any, will be taxable. "

This doesn't account for console gaming though or non-Steam games such as League of Legends and World of Warcraft, which were previously known as the most popular online games.

1,"Pet urine stains are a big pain, especially when you have hard wood floors. Here are some tips on the removal of such stains:

Take some undiluted Hydrogen Peroxide and pour it into a squirt bottle. Spray the stain with this solution and let it remain untouched for around one minute. You should then be able to scrape off the varnish with no difficulty. After doing this, reapply the solution in a generous amount on the area. Let it remain untouched, this time for a longer period of at least two hours. You might have to sand the area and apply hydrogen peroxide many more times, depending on how long back the stain was created and how much surface area it covers. After the stain is off you will have to obviously have to refinish the affected area."

It needs to be well-matched with not just the flooring but with the cabinets, countertops and other furniture - may it be in the kitchen or other rooms. I would personally suggest to paint your kitchen with Amber toned cabinets in combination with blue gray walls that can beautifully create a contrast with stainless kitchen appliances. It will give a fresh, somewhat classy and modern look. But it still depends in the style you want to achieve. :)

1,Great day .... I love real maple syrup!  Now I'm craving a stack of pancakes!

1,No doubt about it. The man has no idea of the wisdom of keeping ones mouth shut.
1,"You may find his interesting:
By ""protest,"" Gertrude doesn't mean ""object"" or ""deny""—these meanings postdate Hamlet. The principal meaning of ""protest"" in Shakespeare's day was ""vow"" or ""declare solemnly,"" a meaning preserved in our use of ""protestation."" When we smugly declare that ""the lady doth protest too much,"" we almost always mean that the lady objects so much as to lose credibility. Gertrude says that Player Queen affirms so much as to lose credibility. Her vows are too elaborate, too artful, too insistent.

And when she dying the next morning I remember falling to my knees and when she died I remember hearing the angels voice! This song haunted me for years after she died. I couldn't handle any Christmas songs actually. I was so bitter, hurt and angry. Until He moved that mountain for me Christmas of 2013 and the pain eased up clearing away the clouds that formed over my heart and soul. But the song still echoed. Until two Christmas's ago when I realized the song or the season had nothing to do with her for I had always had her on the throne and once I took her off of the throne and put Him on the throne I realized that song was no longer a sad song about her rather it was a happy song about Him. Now when I hear it, it's a reminder of where I was and a reassurance of where I am now. It is like a scar. It no longer hurts but the remembrance is still there.

1,"I know of many people who don’t believe in any gods, so by default, they put everything else in front of what they don’t believe."
1,"Sure, but lets be specific . . Which God are you referring to?
I also know people who put all worldly things before Santa, The Easter Bunny, and ""Zorg"" the magical Space Pixie . . .
The ""Worldly things"" you refer to are tangible objects we can interact with . . . Like cell phones, Televisions, Cars . . . They require no ""Faith"" to interact or believe in.
To me, it seems much more odd to believe in unverifiable magic claims, then it does to have actual KNOWLEDGE about the material things we interact with  . . . Daily."
1,"Yes, God isn't as popular as he use to be. Even more so, they seek to be famous themselves through facebook, twitter etc as Aleister Crowley said ""Everyone's A Star."" 
Vanity, devils favourite sin :)
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=G3jaPBFXFTU"
1,"Q ""Do you know any people that put celebrities and all the worldly things before God?""
It is people who make the celebrities and then they idolise them, will nearly do anything for them or to be like them and even almost worship them. They wouldn't be celebrities if people didn't turn them into celebrities in the first place. People can be strange."
1,"I do. They are from the vain world. Glamour is the ultimate at any cost. 
Further, Glamour is there God and the God demands are of drinks, drugs and sex to attain oneness with God."
1,It don't even have to be a different state. I LOVE shopping in other towns just to see what they have! ??

So good luck with that.

Meanwhile, they are on messenger complaining how boring their work is.. Then they come home and are more on messenger.. (for me this is a paradox)
Nobody these days can do deep work anymore bcs they are whole the time distracted by others. If I want to concentrate I get annoyed by people who work in a corporation and have nothing to do while working but just talking to me on messenger.. We just waste each others time and achieve nothing in life.. And when you look back how you spend your life you feel empty and not satisfied because you have achieved nothing only talked  on messenger and complaining how boring life is.."

1,"The dialling code for Canada when calling from the UK is 00 1 followed by the area code of the city you are calling then the telephone number of the house you are calling. You can find a list of area codes for Canada and other countries at www.countrycodes.com/
Whenever you are calling another country outside of the UK the international prefix is always 00. This is then followed by the code assigned to that country; in this case the dialling code for Canada is 1.

If you are calling Canada from a mobile phone in the UK, then the 00 is replaced with a + symbol. So it will be +1 then the city dialling code followed by the phone number. If you have a Smartphone the + symbol should be obvious on your keypad, possibly above the O. If not and it is not immediately obvious where it is then you may need to try pressing and holding 0 or the * to get the + symbol.

If you go to the Country Codes website mentioned above you can get a $5 free prepaid phone card and really good savings on international calls. To call Canada from the UK using a prepaid phone card you will need to dial the access number on the card and then when prompted enter your PIN number. Then all you need to do is follow the instructions above for calling an Canada from the UK using the dialling code 00 1."

1,"Dear Goaty McSheepson,
No; I doubt that Malthus (1766-1834), a clergyman, would ever have suggested euthanasia. He saw population as limited by war, disease, and famine; and his suggestion for an alternative to that, was a form of moral restraint. Although he viewed birth control as sinful, he thought people could marry later in life, which would lead to fewer children.
He is known primarily as the first economist to propose a systematic theory of population; that population growth happens exponentially, while food supply increases arithmetically. However his work did not include the effects of the Industrial Revolution and many other recent factors.

1,"I don't think so. I think he was the guy who suggested that human population growth was limited by the ability to grow food. (Not really THAT clever if you think about it). At some time in the future the amount of food that can be produced will plateau. At that point, so will the human population of the world (if humanity has not put an end to itself in other ways long before that)."
1,"Just a different shine of the light:
It is ""....easy to lose sight of Malthus’s actual conclusion: That because humans have not all starved, economic choices must be at work, and it is the job of an economist to study those choices.""

1,"Chemistry is a fascinating science, full of unusual trivia! Here are some of the interesting fact related to Chemistry.
Chemistry in our body
When someone mentions Chemistry, we generally think of the complex equations and label it boring. Maybe it is the way the subject is taught in schools that make it uninteresting. But did you know thatall of us come across chemistry in everyday life? You’d be surprised to know that Chemistry is everywhere in the world around you! It’s in the food you eat, clothes you wear, water you drink, medicines, air… you name it.
The above thing is given by the reference of the article
https://www.zigya.com/blog/chemistry-in-everyday-life/
According to me a servant of the chemistry is Organic chemistry.  All the is made of carbon and it play vital role in human, nature and all the surrounding things."

1,"Euthanasia can have the following disadvantages
Lack/ poor Human dignity
Pain and regrets to the family of the patients
Can lead to unnecessary deaths if not well governed by the law.
Cost reduction in some cases
The pain one may go through is reduced."
1,"The effects of euthanasia would include: Human rights violation, indignity,, and many more."
0,"If a person is in their death bed and will be in much pain. It should be the family's right to ask for it or decide it. Cancer can be very painful and a long long death and sometimes a very quick death. If a person is in right mind and decides it is the best way, then yes. But not all in the family will agree to it. Even if its the best. Some thinks that during a short time there may be a cure. But not likely."
1,"I don't believe that it's right to make a
person live a life that is unbearable to
them (or to a family if the patient 'isn't there')
just to make other people feel better.
Everybody gets on their little soap box
and shouts out about the RIGHT TO LIVE.
When are they going to do it for the
RIGHT TO DIE?  I do believe that a doctor
ought to be on hand for it and not be a 'do it
yourself' sort of deal.  I don't believe that such
forms of release should be called murder or suicide.
Letting a loved one go is hard to do, but seeing one
laying there, the same color as the sheets and
wasting away, dying by inches, should be harder.
Keeping them alive is a comfort to you, not any sort
of kindness to them.   At that point, dying is a gift.
A loving heart should give it."
1,"Well, tell you the truth it's very illegal to use.

It does have a set back it sometimes don't work."
1,"Actually, to some extent, it is being done today in every hospital in the U.S.  Feeding tubes are being removed, respirators are turned off, ""extra"" morphine is administered to counter pain until it affects the patients ability to continue living.  It is always done with the consent of the family and the doctor must agree, but it is done.  They simply do not call it euthanasia.  It was just done to a good friend of mine about 2 weeks ago.  He had a stroke and was not able to speak, move, or breathe on his own.  He could not eat etc.  They removed his breathing apparatus & increased the morphine, and he died in a matter of a very few hours after 9 days of medical life.  He and his wife had discussed this procedure long before his stroke.  This is a question each of us needs to discuss with family members.  Just how much support do you want from your medical staff and for how long??"
1,"No,but a show I just watched showed there is not much we can do about it unless we start policing the internet first. There is a group of people that have their own business helping people die . They go to other countries that basically allow it to happen instead of fighting it in court.helping put a stop to these group of people doing it."
1,"Yes. If the person asks for it themselves, It is legal
If a baby is born without limbs or perhaps is born in a permanent coma, the mother should have the right to order a mercy killing, or in the same case if the child is severely and permanently injured or is retarded or has syndrome. But people could start abusing the right for euthanasia and soon people might ""mercy"" kill their children if they have ADD or ADHD, or something else not as major.
My final statement would be yes, sometimes living itself is a debt to yourself and its own poison and punishment, far worse than can be described in my short answer for this extremely complicated subject. Those who would disagree can not understand or have not witnessed what pain can really be."

Thank you for your question.

On balance, probably not as there is the temptation to play God. If it is introduced, there should be a number of protections in place.

1,"No, every human being should compensate the life in any situation.It's the God rule.
If you don't believe the god ,then also don't believe the pain.What would you get by killing a person on that reason.Do you remove his pain.No, you are not removing pain but you are taking away the life."
1,"Well, we surely should NOT allow the government to ALLOW and PASS euthanasia. In Fact the government should KEEP it's nose OUT. If a person has a will stating that the person should be allowed to die that is another case. I believe that all people have the CHOICE as to whether they prefer to lay up there and suffer or not. This is a person's choice and we should not allow the government to play God."
1,Not a chance!^_^
1,"Euthanasia should be allowed or not is a negotiable point that can be argued equally on both sides.
Argument defending Euthanasia
Some communities and religion such as Hindus believe under good guidance its morally right to ease the agony of the patient if no signs of recovery. As a was express freedom of choice one is left with that right to make his own choices. Some sickness is too expensive to sustain a patient for some period especially to life support machines but finally, the patient dies. These costs can be reduced through Euthanasia with precise consent. Pain and agony is another point that the patient can face and at times doctors are left with no other option but to listen to the urge to reduce the suffering through Euthanasia
  Arguments Against.
People may take advantages of this practices and cause unnecessary deaths. While other religions believe its morally upright others feels that God is the one who should decide when your life should to an end. If over done can reduce the sense of humanity. Those involved in the practices especialy the relatives of the patients may face a life time regret of there action."
1,"Yea sure, I'd want the option if and when I find myself in a situation that brought me no chance of hope and a ton of pain."
1,"Pro's:
-People with incurable diseases, where treatment wouldn’t affect their quality of life, should have a choice
-Why should you have to live and suffer?
-When people say it is Gods choice, I don’t think God would want you to suffer
-When people are denied Euthanasia, a lot of them end up committing suicide, so euthanasia is a more humane way to die
-Humans should be treated just as well as animals are medically
-There would be no financial burden (medical bills)
-People argue that legalizing euthanasia (assisted suicide) is a way to ensure that no one will die in agony or unremitting suffering"
1,"Euthanasia, as defined, is always a practice under consent either with the client or the relatives.
Pros.
Saves a lot of expenses.
Relieves pain to the patient
Expresses some freedom of decision making.
To some community like Hindus it's morally right and 
Cons
Perceived as an ethical in some religions
No value for human life
If not well regulated by laws  can lead to unnecessary killings in the name of Euthanasia
Can bring regrets in life especially to those who are directly involved."
1,"The pro is that when the economy is well again you will have a good fixed monthly
euthanasia pros and cons"
1,"Euthanasia is derived from the Greek words Euthan (good) and thanatos (death). It refers to the voluntary termination of the life of a person or animal in a painless manner.

Dr. Jack Kevorkian is the name that is cited the most when euthanasia is discussed. He claims to have assisted more than 125 terminally ill patients to die peacefully. Pro-choice activists have always argued that when a person is terminally ill and is in a lot of pain he should be allowed the liberty to choose between life and death. Dr. Kevorkian and his ilk offer a painless death, usually via a drug overdose or withdrawal of life support. There have been documented cases of doctors writing 'do not resuscitate' in their notes in cases concerning terminally ill patients. It is unclear if this can be considered euthanasia.

Euthanasia can be also be non-voluntary when the patient lacks decision-making capacity and their proxies are not informed that the patient is going to be euthanized."
1,"Essentially it is mercy killing. When a person (or an animal for that matter) is so ill that their life has no quality, and there is no real hope that they will get better, some people believe that is kinder to help that being to die peacefully rather than continue suffering.

It is done routinely for pets when their condition cannot be treated, but the case for the same thing being available for humans is still a passionately debated issue."

1,"It is quite hard tricky to determine the type of wood a furniture is made of. But here are some of the basic ways to know and help you in identifying wood.

1. It is necessary to be certain that furniture is actually a solid wood or if it is a man-made composite that is created to imitate wood.
2. You have to look for the growth rings. This is what determines the age of a tree as it is formed by the tree's yearly growth. If you see an end-grain it is a proof that your furniture is indeed made of genuine wood.
3. Another feature to look out for is the venneer or a repeating grain pattern.
4. Next one is the grain color. However, some wood when exposed mostly by outside elements can turn into a darker shade or even lose color due to age.
5. Texture also gives away the type of wood. If it is perfectly smooth and has no grain indentation, it might probably one f the softwoods. But if it has an open pore structure it is most likely to be hardwoods such as oak, maple or mahogany. It is has a curly grain it can be birch or cherry.
6. You also must consider the hardness, thickness and weight of the wood. Since these features can help you in comparing the density of wood and examine the overall characteristic of it.
Hope this helps.
Oak Beam Suppliers Shropshire - Border Hardwood"
1,"You will want to get a backer board designed for your application. Note that while you have removed the hardwood floor and plywood base you may want to calculate the total thickness of the material removed, or the thickness needed to bring the finished tile surface level with the adjoining floor. I am restoring a 100 year old home and have undertaken the same task. In one room I only removed the finished floor and left the subfloor. Mine was 3/4"" thick so I opted for a backer board that was 1/2"" thick. With my thinset motar and tile thickness, my finished floor levels for new and existing will be the same.
Be sure to follow manufacturer's installation instructions for your backerboard.
 
Good Luck"
1,Unfortunately I just found out the hard way. I've had my engineered Brazilian Cherry wood floor down less than 1 year after noticing some cupping in certain areas. I just removed a section today and discovered a termite infestation. The termites were attracted to the wood and ate through the floor pad to get at it. These are subterranean termites that got in through cracks in the foundation that I though I had sealed up. The wood buckled due to moisture from the termites mud tubes and being eaten by the termites. I'm now forced to remove all the wood and have the foundation treated for termites and the slab sealed before putting the wood back down. I live in the Orlando Fl area where apparently the risk of termite damage is high.

1,"Each person will react differently to demonic possession, but you only need to look as far as the Bible for what possession by a demon is like.

If you need help figuring out whether someone has been possessed, here are the symptoms to look out for:

What happens to someone who is possessed by the Devil

Although many people might not believe in Satanic possessions, the truth is this phenomenon is actually mentioned in the Bible.

According to the Bible, there are several signs and symptoms of possession:

The demon's personality takes over the host's- All signs of a person's personality will slowly disappear, and be replaced by the demonic personality of the spirit within:
Suddenly they shouted, ""What have you to do with us, Son of God? Have you come here to torment us before the time?"" (Matthew 8:29).

Loss of control- A person who is possessed loses all control of bodily movement and functions:
And when the demon was cast out, the mute man spoke: And the multitudes marveled, saying, It was never so seen in Israel (Matthew 9:33) A possessed person will begin speaking in a different voice- the victim may also use tongues or languages they didn't previously know. Very commonly, ancient languages like Aramaic are used.
Unusual abilities- A person who is possessed might suddenly develop super-human strength and the ability to physically do things that other humans can't. Their knowledge and wisdom (especially of history) might also increase.
So these are the signs to look out for, according to the Bible, but if you genuinely fear that you (or someone you know) has been possessed, then I recommend you get yourself to a priest as soon as possible!"
1,"Demons are very real. I didn't used to believe until it happened to me.

Satan will do all he can to weaken a person, making them easier to take over.

Prayer and belief in Christ is the only thing that helps."
0,"Trust us you don't want this.
It has been like this for 25 years, no one can help, no one understands.
You do NOT want this."
1,"There is nothing glamorous about being possessed by the Devil. I know because I have been and am still dealing with the repercussions of this. I didn't make this choice it was made for me based on a life or death situation.

I think you should be careful in what you say or do because by the intention of putting forth such a request you are putting yourself in an environment that will make you exposed to anything or anyone- and this is definitely not what you want because it will attract things that you do not want in your life and eventually it will destroy your life as well as those people or things around you that you care about.

Shows like the ""Haunting"" seem to want to make it seem as though a possession is something you can try out like a new type of cuisine or something and if you don't like it you can just remove yourself from it or um, not try it again?(Ha Ha, right)

It doesn't work like this AT ALL.
Once you put yourself into this world that's it, there is no walking away or turning back. It can subside somewhat by spending much time and effort, and quite often money to exorcise it or send it away but it is and never will be an easy task.

You literally pay for this with your life and you will be imprisoned as long as you live and you will die as a result of this."
1,"Spiritual possession is what occurs when a demon, spirit, animal, or any other disincarnate entity starts to control a body that is not its own.

While the signs of possession are varied some of the changes include changes in personality; in sleep patterns; in weight (that is either loss or gain); and personal hygiene.

Possessed people may start to curse excessively which is typically out of character. Another typical sign to look out for is a sudden aversion to religious items. Such people may take up self- mutilation and become violent.

They may seem to take on a different personality or suffer from multiple personality disorder. Possessed people may seemingly suffer from blackouts in their memory.

They often collect occult materials and become sexually pre-occupied.

According to the Catholic Church, true signs of possession would include a display of superhuman strength, frequently accompanied by fits and convulsions; personality changes; possession of knowledge of the possibly the future or other private information."

0,"Why would you want to see how it feels to be possessed? Possession is real, the spiritual world is real, and many people take it so lightly.

The only purpose that satan has for us is to destroy us, and to influence us to destroy ourselves. This is no joke, hell is not a fairytale- please be careful what you wish for, my recommendation for you would be Bible study."
1,"Possession is not a game. It is easy to become possessed but extremely difficult to get rid of that spirit. I am speaking from experience so don't even go there.

I would suggest you get possessed by the Holy spirit. You will never be the same. You will speak things you don't understand and do things you don't understand and dance and feel like there's no reason gravity should have any control over you.

It's so much more awesome than evil spirits. Try that dude. Either which way your soul goes to whoever possesses it. Think about that too."
1,"Since the idea of possession is anti-scientific and goes against all that humans have learned about how psychiatric disorders work, the best answer perhaps it to say that you can just assume that you are not possessed. In the past people with metal illness were said to be 'possessed'. Our culture has thankfully moved beyond those times.
Science and medicine have shown us that events and diseases have natural sources, not supernatural."

Look at the world and what's happening to those people who didn't deserve (and children) or didn't ask to die but yet your GOD is so easily ready to decide who lives and who dies. There is no right or wrong, it's called CHOICE.

So those of you who read the Bible and believe in GOD good for you but you know what your kid/s could be walking home from school and get hit by a car who is the first person you blame after the driver- GOD

So leave the preaching to those who go to church..I believe in the devil and everything that goes with it, it might be bad but at least you know you're going to die, not live a lie believing in something that is going to kill us all and hide behind a cross."
1,"You don't want to be possessed its like someone doing their bidding while you get the bad end of the deal( mostly death). You won't feel anything because you will black out and won't remember.

I haven't been possessed before or anybody else but I bet it won't be a fun ride."
1,"Devils are real. We Catholics believe that. Even in other religion there is evidence that there were and are devils.

Yes, they are right - being possessed is not a joke. It will make your life miserable and may cause your death.

To those who don't believe that there are devils even if you're not a Catholic just read the Bible."
1,"I believe the devil is in all of us, but sometimes the devil wants some of us
to have a higher percentage of evil. I don't think just anyone can be possessed,
only those worth possessing and corrupting.

I, for example am evil at heart. I feel like the only thing stopping me from doing terrible things is the law. Because of this demons will ignore me, knowing that sooner or later I will show how evil I can be.

You want to be possessed, and from that I can deduce that you are on the evil side of the spectrum, and are less likely to be possessed. So I guess you're shit outta luck, pal"

1,"Each person will react differently to demonic possession, but you only need to look as far as the Bible for what possession by a demon is like.

If you need help figuring out whether someone has been possessed, here are the symptoms to look out for:

What happens to someone who is possessed by the Devil

Although many people might not believe in Satanic possessions, the truth is this phenomenon is actually mentioned in the Bible.

According to the Bible, there are several signs and symptoms of possession:

The demon's personality takes over the host's- All signs of a person's personality will slowly disappear, and be replaced by the demonic personality of the spirit within:
Suddenly they shouted, ""What have you to do with us, Son of God? Have you come here to torment us before the time?"" (Matthew 8:29).

Loss of control- A person who is possessed loses all control of bodily movement and functions:
And when the demon was cast out, the mute man spoke: And the multitudes marveled, saying, It was never so seen in Israel (Matthew 9:33) A possessed person will begin speaking in a different voice- the victim may also use tongues or languages they didn't previously know. Very commonly, ancient languages like Aramaic are used.
Unusual abilities- A person who is possessed might suddenly develop super-human strength and the ability to physically do things that other humans can't. Their knowledge and wisdom (especially of history) might also increase.
So these are the signs to look out for, according to the Bible, but if you genuinely fear that you (or someone you know) has been possessed, then I recommend you get yourself to a priest as soon as possible!"
1,"Demons are very real. I didn't used to believe until it happened to me.

Satan will do all he can to weaken a person, making them easier to take over.

Prayer and belief in Christ is the only thing that helps."
0,"Trust us you don't want this.
It has been like this for 25 years, no one can help, no one understands.
You do NOT want this."
1,"There is nothing glamorous about being possessed by the Devil. I know because I have been and am still dealing with the repercussions of this. I didn't make this choice it was made for me based on a life or death situation.

I think you should be careful in what you say or do because by the intention of putting forth such a request you are putting yourself in an environment that will make you exposed to anything or anyone- and this is definitely not what you want because it will attract things that you do not want in your life and eventually it will destroy your life as well as those people or things around you that you care about.

Shows like the ""Haunting"" seem to want to make it seem as though a possession is something you can try out like a new type of cuisine or something and if you don't like it you can just remove yourself from it or um, not try it again?(Ha Ha, right)

It doesn't work like this AT ALL.
Once you put yourself into this world that's it, there is no walking away or turning back. It can subside somewhat by spending much time and effort, and quite often money to exorcise it or send it away but it is and never will be an easy task.

You literally pay for this with your life and you will be imprisoned as long as you live and you will die as a result of this."
1,"Spiritual possession is what occurs when a demon, spirit, animal, or any other disincarnate entity starts to control a body that is not its own.

While the signs of possession are varied some of the changes include changes in personality; in sleep patterns; in weight (that is either loss or gain); and personal hygiene.

Possessed people may start to curse excessively which is typically out of character. Another typical sign to look out for is a sudden aversion to religious items. Such people may take up self- mutilation and become violent.

They may seem to take on a different personality or suffer from multiple personality disorder. Possessed people may seemingly suffer from blackouts in their memory.

They often collect occult materials and become sexually pre-occupied.

According to the Catholic Church, true signs of possession would include a display of superhuman strength, frequently accompanied by fits and convulsions; personality changes; possession of knowledge of the possibly the future or other private information."

0,the enemy will get the best of you but you have to fight him.
1,"To start there is no such thing as devil, it is the people with devilish behaviour. Possessing? Yes, people tend to take advantage of others because of their circumstances."
1,"A quick way to find out is, are you able to say this? ""Jesus is My Lord and Savior"" if you can't say it even when you try - there is a possession."
1,"I've been possesed 3 times already & I'm only 13!
The ghost that possessed me was verbally violent & people would say that I was cussing. But I couldn't remember cussing."
0,"Things come out of your mouth that you don't want to say, and you do things that you have no control over- this sort of thing happens after too much gin and tonic, in my experience.

No need to invoke the devil and his tricky demands for your eternal soul."
1,"I think maybe you are just a little sensitive or full of a little nervous emotions. I don't think there are really devils or ghosts, or anything else. The only thing we may sometimes think mysterious is just our spirit.

So my friend, don' t trust anything like that. Trust yourself!"
0,"Why would you want to see how it feels to be possessed? Possession is real, the spiritual world is real, and many people take it so lightly.

The only purpose that satan has for us is to destroy us, and to influence us to destroy ourselves. This is no joke, hell is not a fairytale- please be careful what you wish for, my recommendation for you would be Bible study."
1,"Possession is not a game. It is easy to become possessed but extremely difficult to get rid of that spirit. I am speaking from experience so don't even go there.

I would suggest you get possessed by the Holy spirit. You will never be the same. You will speak things you don't understand and do things you don't understand and dance and feel like there's no reason gravity should have any control over you.

It's so much more awesome than evil spirits. Try that dude. Either which way your soul goes to whoever possesses it. Think about that too."
1,"Since the idea of possession is anti-scientific and goes against all that humans have learned about how psychiatric disorders work, the best answer perhaps it to say that you can just assume that you are not possessed. In the past people with metal illness were said to be 'possessed'. Our culture has thankfully moved beyond those times.
Science and medicine have shown us that events and diseases have natural sources, not supernatural."
0,"Wwjd4iana, according to you, most of the world is possessed then, because why on earth would anyone who is not a Christian say that? Such a declaration of faith would be compromising their own beliefs."
0,You have to be easy to manipulate. You are not. You are thinking too much.
1,"Turn to JESUS, He is the only one that can SAVE you & His name is the only name that can cast out the demons in your life!! I will pray for you!!! God bless!"
1,"What happens if you want it to happen, I have read the Bible and I have gone to church a bit actually and to me it's all because I believe that the devil is more real and more alive then God himself

Look at the world and what's happening to those people who didn't deserve (and children) or didn't ask to die but yet your GOD is so easily ready to decide who lives and who dies. There is no right or wrong, it's called CHOICE.

So those of you who read the Bible and believe in GOD good for you but you know what your kid/s could be walking home from school and get hit by a car who is the first person you blame after the driver- GOD

So leave the preaching to those who go to church..I believe in the devil and everything that goes with it, it might be bad but at least you know you're going to die, not live a lie believing in something that is going to kill us all and hide behind a cross."
1,"You don't want to be possessed its like someone doing their bidding while you get the bad end of the deal( mostly death). You won't feel anything because you will black out and won't remember.

I haven't been possessed before or anybody else but I bet it won't be a fun ride."
1,"Devils are real. We Catholics believe that. Even in other religion there is evidence that there were and are devils.

Yes, they are right - being possessed is not a joke. It will make your life miserable and may cause your death.

To those who don't believe that there are devils even if you're not a Catholic just read the Bible."
1,"I believe the devil is in all of us, but sometimes the devil wants some of us
to have a higher percentage of evil. I don't think just anyone can be possessed,
only those worth possessing and corrupting.

I, for example am evil at heart. I feel like the only thing stopping me from doing terrible things is the law. Because of this demons will ignore me, knowing that sooner or later I will show how evil I can be.

You want to be possessed, and from that I can deduce that you are on the evil side of the spectrum, and are less likely to be possessed. So I guess you're shit outta luck, pal"
1,"I don't personally believe in any entity that is responsible for ""Evil"".
I do believe he is a self serving narcissistic person, who's selfish pride now effects billions rather then just himself.
If I thought he believed in an ""After Life"" . . . He is trying to make the loudest explosion possible to get his father's attention."

1,"Engineered wood floors are man-made (think plywood) in layers and glued/epoxied/or heat-joined. While to the layman's eye there isn't a world of difference in their looks (there is a difference tho'), engineered floors are usually more scratch/wear resistant than real solid wood floors. However, if you gouge or deeply scratch an engineered floor, the difference in the layers will be evident whereas a solid wood floor is basically the same color throughout the plank. Some engineered wood is water resistant, but to my knowledge none is water proof. When an engineered floor gets soaked, as in a flood, the floor pieces begin to separate and curl (ugly) real wood floors, if properly attached, will not ""come apart"", but it will warp/shrink/mold overtime. But with real wood, you can REsand REshape and REfinish the floor...with engineered wood you can only REplace! Hope this helps... :)"

1,"People are born with absolutely no knowledge of religion. Religion is taught, therefore, people are born non-believers."
1,"The definition of ""theist"" is one who believes in the existence of god or gods.  The definition of ""a-thiest"" is one who does NOT (the ""a"" prefix) believe in god or gods. It is that simple.  
There are flavors of atheists beyond that, but lack of belief is at the core of them all.  Therefore, since a baby only ""knows"" what it is taught, it is, by default, an atheist -- a blank slate."
1,"People tend to adapt to the faith of their parents, based on the region they live in. If you are born in the US, you are more likely than not, a Christian; In Iraq, a Muslim; in India, a Hindu. Religious faith is learned, NOT inborn. Believers are taught belief by other believers."
0,"I think newborns are completely devoid of any sense of self or any other entity other than their immediate personal needs. They run on instinct .. To suckle and feed, because that is a survival instinct ... Beyond basic instinct is learned skills, and knowledge."
1,"If people were born theists ... Or believing in a god ... Then EVERYBODY would be born with the same belief.  The belief in the true god(s).  Obviously, that is not the case, or there would not be hundreds of religions.  (sects, yes - but not completely differing religions)"
0,"It would be an interesting experiment. Raise a child to 25 or so without any religious paraphernalia at all. No indoctrination.
I totally doubt she'd have faith of any supernatural kind.
Kind of impossible though. Believers in the supernatural salivate at the sight of young children. Not in any Subway sense, just at the thought that with the right method of persuasion, the child would enter their ranks and keep their faction one person further from obsolescence."
1,"Since the base meaning of the word ""Atheism"" is ""Without God - No God"", we are born Atheist lack both the knowledge of the concept regarding God/Gods and along with any other knowledge other then our base instincts (the need to eat to stay alive).
Since this is not a conscious decision to choose NOT to believe in the concepts of religion, it is implicit. It is usually by cultural traditions that we indoctrinate our children. Hence, why some believe in one type of God, while others, another or none."
0,"Do recall reading, some years ago, that someone has posited that people were born with a genetic disposition for or against  belief. They called it the ""God gene"".  Don't recall much beyond that, but do recall that there was quite a huhu about it at the time. "

0,"Contrary to what a lot of the people here think we are not born blank slates and we are born with the mechanisms to at least be shunted toward the religious state, though not anything so specific as a god.
Take our pattern recognition ability and out attribution of agency ability. We see patterns and we attribute these patterns to agency, thus some forms of primitive religion is born.
Now babies would have no concept of gods though they have abilities such as folk physics, folk biology and the like. Gods are a very specific entity needing much in the way of human complication for their existence
So babies would be born atheist, having no belief in gods. . "
1,"People are born with a clean slate, it's their parents and associates that place beliefs in their heads. My children had no influence to or away from religion from my wife or myself. They were allowed to go to church with their friends, and received answers to their religious questions in a nonpartisan way. All but one out of five is atheist."
0,"Neither. They are born believers because they are magical thinkers. Children engage in imaginative play.  They ask a lot of questions, what happens when you die? What is death? Children engage in play in order to learn acceptance or make up their own minds. No person is completely logical we all dream and we all buy into superstitions. Would you buy and wear a dead mans coat? What if he'd been a murderer? No, because somehow you think his essence is attached, hence why we hold on to loved ones items. "
0,No we all have to be taught that there is no Creator. As we grow and look at the awesom universe and all we have on earth to sustain life  the question come up who made all this? Genesis 1:1

0,"Well, there was a fluff-up about a genetic ""god gene tenor twelve years ago or so (maybe longer - time flies when you are an oldz), which posited that some of us were born with a genetic predisposition to believe in the supernatural.  I don't know, but it does seem to me that some of us need to believe, and some of us just can't see the logic in that.  What scares me about the believers is that deep in a large chunk of humanity is a need to dictate behavior to the rest of us.  Combine those two and things can be ugly.  My personal feeling is that you can believe whatever silly stuff you want as long as you don't expect me to conform to your dogma, or acknowledge that your belief system is superior to mine. "
1,"When we are born our minds are undeveloped and without knowledge. As we grow, we learn.
The children of religious parents are taught there is a God. They trust their parents and, for a time, believe.
Some set it aside and move on to other things; others hold their parents' belief all their lives.
But at the point of birth? Their minds are a clean slate. Well, more of a palimpsest, I suppose."

0,"No. I completely agree with Cookie Hill. Children naturally are born inquisitive about how we got here and who created the wonderful earth on which we live as well as this amazing awe inspiring universe and it's various cycles. We find the answer at Genesis 1:1 and Isaiah 45:18. When I meet and speak with atheists, one of the questions I always ask is ""Have you always been an atheist?"" Thus far, the answer that I've always received is no. We have all the reasons to believe that there is a Creator than not to believe that there is one. Interestingly, even when one chooses not to believe in a Creator, they still feel inclined to attribute it to something. I think it speaks to our innate desire to acknowledge that this amazing earth on which we live didn't just happen. For every cause there is an effect."

1,"people misinterpret the bible, thinking that being gay is a sin. Also, people (christians) throw their beliefs on others and it sucks. I personally have experienced hate while i was at a private christian school because i was gay. The only thing making people believe that your sexual orientation is a sin is beliefs and ignorance."
1,Some would say that being gay is a demon that can be cast out.
0,"Because they pick and choose what Bible verses to believe .. And the Old Testament in Leviticus says that homosexuality is a sin deserving death. 
Of course, it also says not to eat certain things or wear clothing made of multiple materials ... Which they conveniently ignore."

1,Your sexual orientation has nothing to do with hell or heaven because both don't exist. You live right and do whatever makes you happy without hurting other. Hell or heaven created by you with the kind of living you do.
1,"If you are referring to one of the three monothestic religions the reason it was frowned on was because homosexuality was often seen in temple prostitution to other gods such as Ishtar. It is the homosexual act that is ""taboo""often translated as an abomination in the bible.
It is also noted that when man and woman join in love they become one flesh.
In Genesis 2:22 Woman was made from man's rib/side. In Jewish Midrash Adam or Adama was both male and female androgenous.
The LORD God fashioned into a woman the rib which He had taken from the man, and brought her to the man. The man said, ""This is now bone of my bones, And flesh of my flesh; She shall be called Woman, Because she was taken out of Man."" For this reason a man shall leave his father and his mother, and be joined to his wife; and they shall become one flesh.

Genesis 2:24
Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: And they shall be one flesh.
Mark 10:8
And they twain shall be one flesh: So then they are no more twain, but one flesh.
Cor 6:16
Or do you not know that the one who joins himself to a prostitute is one body with her? For He says, ""THE TWO SHALL BECOME ONE FLESH.""

0,"Q ""Why do some people think you'll go to hell just for being gay? Like can't you have an opinion over who you want to love??""
Let's start with what you have boiled it down to: ""can't you have an opinion over who you want to love??""
If, say, it's just a handful of you on an Island by yourselves where no rules apply [extremely impractical, of course] then perhaps you cannot only have an opinion over who you want to love, be it your neighbour's wife, daughter or son, [or even all three] or what you want to smoke or snort but you can go ahead and act on that opinion.
However, if you want to organise yourselves into a smoothly functioning society then you will need rules or laws for the wellbeing and future of your society. Even in the most liberal of societies you will have limits beyond which you cannot put your opinions into practice. In the more conservative ones you might be taken to task for just expressing certain opinions, let alone acting upon them.
If a society enacts a certain law it will stipulate what it considers appropriate punishment for any breach of the law. Where a law accepted by a society comes from, or is claimed to come from, an external source [federal, international or ""God""] then that source will most likely have stipulated what it considers appropriate punishment for any breach of the law [be it imprisonment, lashes, stoning or a spell in hell, or any combination thereof]."
0,"I'm a Catholic, but I have to say that I don't believe in a lot of things that the Church teaches.
First, I believe that an individual's relationship with God is between that person and God, and nobody else.  This is why I do not believe in confession.  First of all, God will know what sins I have committed, and he will know if I am repentant.  What reason is there to go and confess your transgressions to another human being?
As far as going to Hell when you die, I believe that only people who are evil and have committed evil deeds while they were alive wind up going to Hell.
Even if you never went to a mass in your entire life, but you are a good person with a kind heart, then you are going to go to Heaven.
Being gay certainly does NOT make you evil.  You are allowed to love who you want to love.  If that happens to be another man or another woman, or both, so be it.
I firmly believe that what determines where you go in the afterlife depends fully on how you treated other living things when you were on Earth. 
If you were malicious and you constantly hurt others and aimed to destroy the happiness of others, then you will reap what you sow."

Potential solutions:
If you’re using a Micro SD card in your Note 4, then that’s the
first thing to check. Remove the card from your phone and test to see if
the random reboots still occur. If the reboots have stopped then back
up the data from the card on your computer and try reformatting it on
the Note 4 via Settings > Storage > Format SD card.
You could try a factory reset. Make sure you have all your data backed up. Go to Settings > Backup and reset > Factory data reset > Reset device > Erase everything.

Restart your phone in safe mode if it doesn't do it anymore then it is more than likely an app that's causing the problem."

 If I watch TV it tends to be along the lines of David Attenborough, humans living in diverse settings or history. What have I learned? That mankind is unnatural in its way, and destructive, we wasn't always so. That tribes live long lives without western medicine, for they have lived in harmony with the spirit of nature. It hasn't been western society teaching tribal culture how to cure but the other way round. Much of our sickness is due to living in close proximity and the state of our food source.  
As for religious texts many point to Sumer the first civilisation whether they have created many gods or used all those god traits in one. Why did we settle and create elaborate buildings and sewage systems? Domesticate cattle and wild grass, create a banking system? All that has ended us here. Wherever we are so is concrete, toxins and poverty. Why would nomad tribes who lived in harmony with the land for thousands of years, choose to settle when common sense told them that creating a surplus food supply makes it vulnerable to control? Whoever controls the food source controls everyone. People talk about religious ideas brainwashing man, many ideas brainwash man besides religion. If they didn't we certainly wouldn't be working at least 40 hours a week, or being fined for rules we did not make. Common law says you ""must not harm your neighbour."" Yet here we are bogged down with statutes and contract law of which none follow that common law, they are there to make our corporations money and everything is a corporation a legal entity.  Still they have enslaved and examined human interaction for years.
 Bill Gates is for vaccination to control the population. Their intent has always been create conflict through polarity, create the solution once society has had enough and has no where else to turn.

A manifestation which will result from a general reactionary movement which will follow the destruction of Christianity and Atheism; both conquered and exterminated at the same time.

1,God can be whatever or whomever. Hey we have santa clause the easter bunny. So who says their not real
0,"Let me answer your questions in reverse.
Is God real?---my answer is ""yes"", I think so""---and I think that for numerous reasons.
Many will say ""no"" also for numerous reasons.
Either they are right or I am right---God's existence is not contingent upon what any human thinks or believes about His existence.
Who is God?    Well, any God worthy of the name would be at least as good as the best person I know, would be all powerful, and would have every good quality I could ever imagine. (Of course, you could think he is cruel and uncaring---but who would want such a God?)
If you want to find Him, you can; and He will reveal Himself to you.
Of course, many people with disagree with me, so maybe the best thing to do is to seek Him by yourself."
1,"God or gods are real.  What they want, who knows?  Religions speculate a lot on the subject.  I believe in the Jewish/Christian/Islamic god.  That does not make me right, I just real it does.  The existence of a god is incontestable. 
St Thomas Aquinas in his 5 proofs of god described it well, either the universe has always existed, came from something else, or was created.  If you accept the first, fine.  If you accept the second, it just pushes the question backwards and is essentially a version of the first, so fine.  If you accept the third you are accepting the existence of a god.  The same arguments to be assigned to where god came from only all three point to a god so for that it is cyclic logic and therefore invalid.
The reason I consider Aquinas's arguments as valid is not where the world/universe came from but rather where did life come from.  I wrote a response discussing life elsewhere on blurt it (philosophy-religion.blurtit.com/4411070/why-do-people-believ).
The steady state theory of the universe, that is to say the theory the universe has always existed has been universally abandoned by all scientific theories. This means life could not have always existed.  Even if you accept the universe came from something else and can be pushed back infinity in time such that the matter/energy that makes up the universe has always existed, with the universe coming into existence especially as described by the Big Bang theory, life did not exist at that moment.  Therefore life came about within the universe.  As described in  my referenced article, life is not unlikely even given the trillions or more of astronomical bodies, it is not improbable, it is not near impossible, IT IS IMPOSSIBLE to occur naturally.  It required a deliberate act.
Please note that the article does not even begin to indicate the actual odds against life.  There are literally hundreds of major biochemical systems within even the simplest of living organisms.  The computations were for just one part of one system.  And as I said randomly it might be possible for any single DNA strand or RNA strand or polypeptide or any lipid or other component to be created by natural means but for all the components to be created all in the same place and at the same time in the exact ratios needed and to be enclosed and segregated such that the biochemical chain of reactions we call life could take place is impossible.
Oh and I have read the theories that life started as a short chain retro virus.  Possibly.  But a retro virus can not reproduce.  It does not have any metabolic pathways.  It depends solely upon the pathways of what ever LIVING cell it enters. That requires some other complete system.  Maybe the retro virus did come first, but it was not alive (depending on your definition of living, it is not alive as it cannot reproduce) until the living cell was subsequently appeared.  Under natural circumstances a single retro virus without any form of host will eventually be broken down.
There is a god or gods.  They may or may not care about us.  They may or may not even know we exist, life itself may be some unnoticed side affect of something they did eons ago.  If life on the earth is deliberate, we may actually be nothing more than a petri dish for making a vaccine or biological weapon.  As to whether any god desires worship, we cannot really know only think and/or believe.  As to whether any god has established rules for our lives, the same. 
I choose to believe that a least one god ""created"" us deliberately and that it cares what happens to us.  How you choose to view the gods is your choice, but I consider you are probably ignorant of biology and biochemistry if you consider life as occurring completely naturally."

""How old are you?""

If you are under a certain age, with religious parents who fearfully indoctrinate the only people gullible enough to accept the nonsense they peddle in a desperate attempt to ensure the next generation keeps making the same mistakes? I'm not going to tell you the truth. Go ahead and keep believing in a daddy god. Sweetie.

If you are over a certain, age, then you need to get over it. There is no god."

didn't just make Him up so we'd all feel better, and then passed that
information down to us? What if we made up God to feel less alone?""
These
are really good questions and we have answers for them. But questions
like these strike fear into the hearts of most parents, so we react with

says blessed are those who have not seen and yet still believe."""

1,"Tell me about yourself. Hi! Good afternoon. This is Arcenal, Rhaff Kesler. I'm 18 years old and currently residing at Mabolo Cebu City. I could state some of my characteristics, I'm optimistic, hardworking and self-motivated person. Optimistic in the sense that I never let myself be affected by those failures I've been before. Hardworking in the sense that I never left my job undone. And, self-motivated in the sense that I tried to enhance myself by overcoming my weaknesses into a strength that will empower me to be better than before. My motto in life is ""I was born to survive."" Since it was stated in the Book of Origin by Charles Darwin that in biological nature of life, there is the existence of ""survival of fittest"" if you're strong you live and if you're weak you die. That's why, I want to be strong because I know that I would be meeting different people in different place at different time.

What are your strengths and weaknesses? As for my strengths, I'm always been a self-starter, always finding ways to improve myself to research, reading and volunteer in various organization. I don't get discourage from simply figuring out puzzle games, solving mathematical problems and frustrating projects in school. However, I love challenges and obstacles, I find fulfillment when I accomplish them, at the same time, my years in UC help me develop my ability to relate with people of all state of life. As for my weakness, maybe I pushed myself too much sometimes that I have to make sure once in awhile that I have enough time to rest and time to have fun so I won't get burned out.

Why call center? Well, I have reasons why I chose this: First, call center industry is quietly related to my course BSIT. Second, I'd like to mingle with different people that would help me gain confidence and I'd like to help aiming for their satisfaction.


Can you describe  a call center environment?
Yes, a call center is a centralised office used for the purpose of receiving and transmitting of a large volume of requests. However, the main objective of this is to administer incoming product support or information inquiries from the consumers. It is often operated in an open workspace, and workstations that include computer for each agent and telephone set/headset which is connected to the telecom switch, and one or more supervisor stations.


Why Aegis? Aside of knowing that the company has been providing excellent service towards other countries and the company is financially stable, I know that Aegis People Support values personal and professional fulfillment of their employees.

1,"If you ask a question, you will most likely get an answer if someone has the knowledge required to answer it.
However, there are some simple things askers can do to make it more likely they will get an answer:
Have a human avatar (it helps answerers feel like they're addressing someone, or helping someone out)
Ask the question in a clear and concise way. Some questions put people off when they are rambling and incoherent.
Don't be too specific. If you ask something like 'what is the puk code to my Samsung galaxy note with the the phone number 04882044005' - very few people will feel like they can help out.

Whereas, the answer to 'How do I find the PUK code on a Samsung?' might resonate with more people and be just as useful.
Ask something interesting.

Yes, we're here to try and help people out regardless of what the question is - but it's nice to answer interesting questions, so these will always get more attention."

1,"Preparation is key to a successful interview

Does the idea of going to a job interview make you feel a little queasy? Many people find that it is the hardest part of the hiring process. But it doesn't have to be. The more you prepare and practice, the more comfortable you will feel. Increase your odds of landing the job you want by brushing up on your interview skills.

Prepare before you go.
Find out all you can about the company before you go to the interview. Understand the products that they produce and/or the services that they provide. It's also good to know who the customers are and who the major competitors are.

Practice makes perfect.
It will also make you feel more confident and relaxed. So, practice your answers to common questions. Make a list of questions to ask, too. Almost all interviewers will ask if you have questions. This is a great opportunity for you to show that you have done your homework and have put some thought into your questions

Make a great impression.
The interview is your chance to show that you are the best person for the job. Your application or resume has already exhibited that you are qualified. Now it 's up to you to show how your skills and experience match this position and this company.

The employer will be looking and listening to determine if you are a good fit. He/she will be looking for a number of different qualities, in addition to the skills that you possess. To make the best impression, dress appropriately; sell your strengths; arrive early, by about 10-15 minutes; be enthusiastic; shake hands firmly; be an active listener; sit up straight and maintain eye contact; ask questions.

Say ""thank you"".
After the interview, follow up with a thank-you note. This is a chance for you to restate your interest and how you can benefit the company. Your best bet is to try to time it so that the note gets there before the hiring decision is made. You should also follow up with a phone call if you don't hear back from the employer within the specified time. Check out some samples:"
1,"Interview is the most important part of your profession or we can say the first step towards your career. Interview is like a blind date, because you are excited and also nervous to meet a person whom you never met.

Remember that you have to prepare yourself mentally as well physically. The person who met you doesn't know about yourself and you have to convince him by your skills. By abilities you have to prove that you are the one for whom they look forward. You need to realize, however that the first impression are very critical. Many recruiters say that they make a decision just by looking at someone. Thus your goals should be look neat, appropriate and well groomed.

Now come towards the mental preparation because good looks are not enough to get a job. Presumably, you should do your home work for each organization you visit.
Well prepared about the organization, their products, their market value complete information about the organization. With all the preparation, behind you both mental and physically you are ready.

Don't move to that place so early, reach there before 10 to 15 minutes of the given time. Confidently enter to the room; never show any nervousness on your face. If they shake hand then you do, otherwise just sit down. Don't try to start conversation first, you are a guest and be an honorable guest."
1,Prepare some questions and the most important thing is be confident all the time during interview.
1,"Know something about the organisation or company you are applying to. (Check their website) Make sure you have a clean resume and a list of references.
Most of all relax and simply enjoy. Good luck to you."
1,"The first thing you should do is find out about the company you are going to be applying to. Find out what they make, or what they do, find out what as much as you can so that you are knowledgeable in that regard. When interviewing use that information in a response so that the interviewer is aware that you have made an effort to educate yourself about the company,"" I am very interested in working for Jones Inc. I've always found ship building interesting. I have built model ships since I was ten years old."" In other words, pull your knowledge of the company into the conversation in some manner. You can do this via the net or by talking to someone that you may know that is connected with the company. I assume your resume is up to date, if it is not, fix that issue. Be prepared with your answers. You obviously can not know exactly what they are going to ask but generally they will ask a few of the same question...What is your long term employment goals? Why do you want to work for Jones Inc.? That is a good place to drop your knowledge of the company. How does your experience relate to the position you are applying for? What are your salary requirements? On a personal level, if you need a haircut, get one. Wear a button up the front shirt, tuck it in and wear a tie if you have one. Do not wear pants that are drooping low. If you have nice leather dress shoes, wear them. I know that is the style but the man/woman you are interviewing with is not a going to be a teen and most professional people do not dress like kids. If you are applying for a professional job, look professional. A suit, in this instance, would be nice. Do not wear any strong or overpowering after-shave or cologne. Remember your manners that Mama taught you...yes sir, no sir, thank you, shake hands etc. You probably know all of these things but I am a former personnel manager and you would be amazed at the people who do not, or possibly, they think they do not matter....they do."
1,"The first thing you need to do is confirm about the date, venue, time of the interview and make a note about it.
Research, research and research!!!! Research about the company and it's products. Research about the skills and stuff related to the job profile. Research about yourself- Study your resume, have your dress for interview ready, etc.
Prepare for personal and technical round. Study everything related to your current field.
Make a list of questions you would like to ask the interviewer. Do not forget this."
1,"The interview depends on the role you are applied for. If it’s technical role the interviewer will ask the questions from your subject and what you mentioned the skills in resume. Moreover the interviewer will check your communication skills and confidence levels.
Before attending the interview you can practice interview questions through some career guidance websites or practice mock interview in real-time. But, I prefer online mock interviews because practical knowledge is better than theoretical knowledge.
You can visit InterviewBuddy- (Online mock interviews with experts). It’s the best website to practice and prepare the interviews.
They will conduct the practice interviews on any stream with industry experts and provide detailed report with performance-based metrics comprehensive feedback on your strengths &weaknesses.

In an any interview, The interviewer will analyze your confidence levels. So, you have to boost your confidence levels with interview buddy."
1,"If you want to successfully crack the interview, then you should also have your knowledge updated. You need to be aware of present day technology and market scenario."
1,"Your question is related for preparation for an interview. Everyone has to pass the phase of interview while he's going for some job. And those who complete this phase successfully they get a job. It's a very simple rule. For knowing this, you should know why people fail in some interview. The reason is very simple, because they lose their confidence.

So if you want to be successful in some interview you should follow the following points.
Be prepared yourself for an interview by reading newspapers daily. Keep in touch with the current affairs and world's present situations. Practice in front of some friends and if they are not available then practice in front of mirror for an interview. This will build up your confidence. Don't interrupt the interviewer in his discussion. It can make him/her furious. Don't try to answer a question when the question is still in progress. If you'll try to show your efficiency in an interview it can irritate the employer. You can prove it later on in your work. I hope you've got the basic and most important points. And you will keep them in your mind. Best of luck."
1,"Yes, you Photoshop can edit videos from versions CS3 Extended and onwards.  The best versions of Photoshop for video editing, however, are CC and CS6. 
You should note that while Photoshop can edit videos, you should only really use it for fairly simple edits.  For more comprehensive video editing, you should try alternative software, such as Final Cut.  That being said, here's a quick tutorial of how to use Photoshop to edit videos.
How to get started with Photoshop video editing
You firstly need to open Photoshop.
Navigate to to ""Window"".
Click on ""Workspace"".
Click on ""Motion"".
Locate the video file you'd like to edit and drag/drop it onto the Photoshop window.
You're now free to edit the clip.  You can alter audio settings, add filters to the video, splicing the clip into different parts, add a new soundtrack, and loads more.
When you've finished your edit you need to click ""File"", then ""Export"", then ""Render Video"".
That's all there is to it.  Photoshop is more than capable of editing basic video files, but as I mentioned earlier, you may want to look at more comprehensive video editing software such as Final Cut if you're looking to make lots of awesome videos.
Here's a great tutorial for how to edit videos in Photoshop CS6:"

Every digital movie has separate tracks for sound and video. A video is a sequence of frames. A single frame is a picture or an image.

If we want to have both track separate then open the movie in the Adobe Premiere. The VCD (.that) file format is not supported by the Adobe Premiere. The movie must be in AVI, MPG or any other supported format. We can convert the file formats by using different video converter software.

Once we have opened the movie, we can seed the project window, a time line and a video window. On the time line we can see the at least two tracks, one for video and for the sound. We can right click of the sound track and then select the save option. The sound track will be saved separately.  Normally, this track is saved in Wave format. We can convert the wave file format to any other file format, if required. This can be done by using the sound converter software. The converter software can be found at download.com"

1,"If it is 10am PST then in India it will be 10.30pm. The time zones indicate that India is 12.5 hours ahead of Los Angeles PST.

How to calculate time zones?
Everyone is aware that there are a number of time zones around the world that represent people on one side of the world waking up while the other people on the opposite side of the globe are going to sleep. It is relatively simple to calculate the various times around the world but you need to make sure you understand the time zones.

Step 1
The first thing you must do is decide which time zone the country you are referring to is in. For example, the vast size of the United States indicates that there are different time zones for the east side of the country and the west side of the country. In this case you will need to discover if you are in the east or west of the Prime Meridian time zone. This time zone line runs through Greenwich in the United Kingdom, therefore anything on the east of the line will be ahead in time whereas the west will be behind.

Step 2

1,"Adobe Premiere is a world know video editing software for both professional and home users. We can use Adobe Premiere to separate the sound track from video track. Every digital movie has separate tracks for sound and video. A video is a sequence of frames. A single frame is a picture or an image.

If we want to have both track separate then open the movie in the Adobe Premiere. The VCD (.that) file format is not supported by the Adobe Premiere. The movie must be in AVI, MPG or any other supported format. We can convert the file formats by using different video converter software.

Once we have opened the movie, we can seed the project window, a time line and a video window. On the time line we can see the at least two tracks, one for video and for the sound. We can right click of the sound track and then select the save option. The sound track will be saved separately.  Normally, this track is saved in Wave format. We can convert the wave file format to any other file format, if required. This can be done by using the sound converter software. The converter software can be found at download.com"
1,"The method of separating sound from video is that first of all by using VirtualDub we will separate from the video and save it in .WAV type. This .Wav file runs through cool Edit 96 and if we want any change, we can edit where required. This tape to which we are converting is recorded in hi-fi stereo, some time one side of the type become higher in level as compare to other side. We will then run .WAV file with the help of Diamond Cut Audio Restoration Tools. This tool is only use to smooth out any impulse noise in our source audio. After this, we will convert this .WAV file in to AC3 by using ffmpegGUI. This GUI has the same rate of bit that TMPGEnc take during the encoding of mp2 in frame serving job. The new AC3 file is same as mp2 in size. Then we will discard the mp2 in favor of AC3 for authoring to DVD.
We can do any sound enhancement with the help of DC-ART. We will start to handle 1st generation tapes. These tapes may be stereo or may be monaural audio."

1,"A ZIP file is a compressed file, which means that it will take up less storage space than an uncompressed file and it can be transferred to other computers much more quickly. There is no difference whatsoever in working with files that have compressed to those that have not. If you find that you need to send lots of different files by email, it makes sense to compress them into a ZIP file so you only have to send one folder as opposed to many files.

If you want to extract a folder or a file from a compressed folder, the first thing that you need to do is to locate the compressed folder. Double-click onto to it to open it, and then drag the folder or file to a new location.

If you want to remove all of the contents from the compressed folder, place your cursor onto the folder and right click it. You then click ‘extract all’ and follow the instructions.

Once you have found the file that you want to make into a Jpeg, simply open it and then click on ‘save as’. Underneath the file name, you will find a drop down menu. Click onto that and you can then just click onto JPEG and then ‘save’.  Be aware, though, that Jpeg files are also highly compressed.

A word of warning about the types of files that you may want to add to a compressed folder: If they happen to be encrypted for security reasons, they will be unencrypted once they are extracted, so you may disclose personal or data protected information without being aware of it. To make sure that this does not happen, don’t compress encrypted files into a ZIP file."

These drugs work to increase the serotonin in the body, which makes a person feel better, but also lessens arousal by calming the nervous system. One of the unfortunate side effects of PE can be depression, so taking these medications can help with any signs of depression while aiding a man during inter**se. Before taking any sort of medication you should talk to a doctor. Again, taking pills really shouldn't be a long-term solution to PE since it just masks the original problem.

You should experiment with different brands and lines until you hit the perfect spot, because since everybody’s skin is different, what works for someone else, may not work for you.

1,"I would first sit down with my family and figure out how much money they would need to completely get themselves out of debt. Then build them all new homes, nothing fancy but whatever they needed and make sure the taxes are paid up to date maybe longer. For my Niece and Nephews, I would put fifty thousand dollars in a trust fund for each of them to draw from or completely withdraw at the age of 25yrs old, on the condition that they have graduated college or at least in college with a respectable GPA.
Then I would spend a lil on myself. Pay all of my medical bills which is basically all that I owe. Buy a small piece of land near Caverun or someplace like that. Build a small wooden cabin with a wrap around deck. So that I could sit on the porch and drink my coffee in the morning while the sun rises, and grill out on the back deck in the evening and watch the sunset.
Go back and finish school, further my education and graduate college, buy a small business and be my own boss. That's right I would still work. I think I would donate a reasonable amount of money to the Rural Schools in Eastern Kentucky so they could buy new computers and etc. I attended several different schools growing up wealthy and poor. Let me tell you there was a big difference.
Anyway,these are just a few things that I would do if I won the Lottery Or Inherited a lot of money. Hypethetically speaking.   "
1,"I would do things for my family that I know are trying to make it but just barely doing so. Make sure my rent and utilities were paid up for a year. Then I would go to the grocery store, and when I see our elderly citizens buying mostly bread and milk, I would walk with them, have them pick out fresh veggies, meat and even a treat.  I would pay for it and move on.     Then the people I know who struggle to pay utilities and medicine /////take them a love offering..    These I would do monthly. There is never a shortage of people who just get by. I can just feel the joy in my heart now and wish I could make it come true.  I am a youngish widow on ss, retire from Nrsg. And someone did things for me, and I know that even having an extra ten dollars makes a poor person feel rich. When all the money is gone, I would be a happy blessed struggling widow again."

0,"First of all, I will thank G-d for the windfall, then, ask HIM to grant me wisdom in the management of such amount of money.
Since I am in a very high state of excitement, under different pressures to buy this and buy that, I will take 3 days before I go to the Lottery Office to collect my cheque. During these 3 days, I will let my mind free to list anything I would always envy to buy (mercedes, sports car, luxirious house, boat cruises, trip around the world, gold necklace and diamonds for my wife, best restaurants, expensive wines, throwing a lavish party)..Then, when my mind is tired of looking for more things to buy, I will take a rest, and chase away any idea of shopping. I will take a white paper, draw 3 columns : On the left side I list those items I deem stupid, in the middle the un-necessary, and in the right the needed. I think, at this point of time, that the bulk of my initial list would be classified as stupid, then few will be un-necessary, and the only thing worthy is the gold necklace for my wife.
Of the $25,000,000.00 I have won, 10% will be set apart to be used as G-d commanded me for any tenth of my income.
Then, I divide the rest equally between me and my wife. I have a rule of 33-33-33-1. It means 33% stay in hard cash, 33% in safe investment such as treasury bonds and gold, 33% in business venture (1/3 real estate, 1/3 stock market, 1/3 reserve funds for these ventures), 1 % to pay for all my debts and to cover my usual expenses.
My goal is that 5 years from now, I will double my asset up to $50,000,000.00. Not all in cash, but in different form.
I'd like to emphasize that I am not quitting my current job, which is doing delivery (I am an independent, and drive my own truck); and I continue to use the money I earn from my work for my regular spendings, instead of taking from the lottery gain.
What could be a problem for me is if my neighbours know about it, and start to behave in a hostile manner. That way, I would move to a more discret, but decent place.
As for the big projects such as saving the world, I have no quick things to offer such as cash donation to charities or foundations. I rather will work for free for people who need a service of transportation during their moving. And, down-to-earth, if I run into homeless and hungry people, I will not give them money but good foods, like let's say a Trio Big Mac, or buy them a bit of grocery (cereals, milk, banana, sliced breads, tomatoe sauce, italian pasta, cheddar cheese, salads).
The long term goal for me is to build creating-job-infrastructures(schools, hospitals, factories) things that will profit many people and generation."
0,"Many people do the lottery each week, or even more than once a week, hoping and praying to win. They often ask themselves what they would do with the money, not really expecting to win.
A win of a million pounds would not be an overwhelming win and it could be used to either provide an interest income to enable the winner to give up work and still have a greatly improved way of life, or it could be treated as a windfall with a spend, spend, spend attitude.
Many lottery winners have said that the changes brought to their lives by the huge win have not really brought them happiness. Dolores McNamara, the Irish woman who won ?77 million in the Euromillions lottery in 2005 is reported to be frightened and overwhelmed by all the interest in her. Not only has she found the press interest daunting, her family has been plagued with death and kidnap threats by people hoping to get some ransom or blackmail money."

I go there everyday to check out the different pokemon, that I wouldnt normally see anywhere else. To check what special pokemon is in the trophy garden, go to the man in the purple suit (I don't remember his name). To get to him, go into the Pokemon mansion on route 212. Then, once you're inside, go to the right, and enter the first door you see. There should be a nurse standing next to that door. The guy you need is the one right in front of you (in the purple suit :P) Talk to him, and answer 'YES' to all of the questions he asks (there is only 2 or 3 questions that he asks, I think. He will then tell you about a pokemon that humped his leg or kissed him on the cheek or something. Thats the special pokemon. Then, the old man next to him will run off somewhere. If you need the pokemon that the guy in the purple suit mentioned, go into the trophy garden (at the back of the mansion), and look for him.  He is rarer than the other pokemon there, so it might take you a little while to find it.

1,"There are two main types of computer software that all computers require to function - system software and application software. System software is the initial software that makes up the underlying functioning of a computer, and provides a platform for applications software to run on. Application software allows computer users to perform tasks and run programs, and could be considered secondary software that builds on primary system software.

System software is the backbone of any computer. It consists of all the files and programs that work to make your computer operate as a computer. System software is automatically provided when you purchase a computer on the high street, and is installed along with the operating system. Providers of system software include Windows and Apple Mac. These offer regular updates which can be installed for free as they become available. Examples of system software include assemblers, system utilities, tools and debuggers.

Application software utilizes the technology provided by system software to allow specific programs to run on a computer. To put it in simple terms, if system software could be considered to be a college timetable, application software could be considered the classes which are incorporated into the timetable. For instance, spreadsheets, word processors and graph templates are all types of application software. Some types of application software are readily installed when you buy a pc. Others will need to be manually installed, through disc or download. There is a limit to how much application software a computer can hold, which depends upon the memory capacity of the computer. What's more, having a large quantity of application software programs installed can slow a computer down. System and application software works closely together to make the modern computer function quickly and effectively; regularly technological improvements ensure the quality of both software types is constantly improving."

Application softwares are used to improve our work ability. Different application softwares and system softwares are used in daily life. Some are productivity software, content software, assessment software, online software, drill and practice software, problem solving software, tutorials, multimedia softwares, stimulation, games, group ware, share ware, spy ware, free ware etc . Some softwares are used to produce and create documents and different presentations.

1,"Led generally stands for light-emitting diode. It is basically a semiconductor mechanism which produces incoherent thin-spectrum light when electrically inclined in the forward direction.

This effect is a kind of electroluminescence. The colour of the discharged light is usually based on the composition and the condition of the semi conducting substance applied, and can be infrared, visible or near-ultraviolet. In the year 1955 Rubin Braunstein of the Radio Corporation of America initially accounted on infrared release from gallium arsenide and various supplementary semiconductor alloys. Research conducted at the Texas Instruments, by Bob Biard and Gary Pittman, discovered in the year 1961 that the gallium arsenide emitted infrared radiance when electric current was applied.

At the point when an appropriate voltage is connected to the leads, electrons can recombine with electron openings inside the gadget, discharging vitality as photons. This impact is called electroluminescence, and the shade of the light (relating to the vitality of the photon) is dictated by the vitality band hole of the semiconductor.

It should be noted that pasting the latter address into the search bar will automatically initiate download of the document.

Writing Handover Notes
Writing a handover note is not as daunting as it may sound. The first step is to jot down basic essential information, such as external and internal contacts; guides to specific computer systems or programs; necessary passwords, although these would be best kept under lock and key until the last minute; documents and where to find them, etc.

Outlining Work
A list of recently completed projects, in case of feedback or queries, as well as outstanding and expected projects should also be prepared. This should include where relevant information, materials or equipment for each project may be located or sourced.

Relevant contact details, both internal and external, as well as completion dates for finished projects and deadlines, timescales, etc for outstanding projects should also be added for each project.
If applicable, financial details should be outlined clearly and in detail.

Polishing the Note
Before finalizing the note, it is advisable to go through all details again and ensure nothing vital has been missed. Details should then be presented in a clear, precise manner.

There is no need to give step by step instructions on how to complete a project. Not only will a successor know how to do the job, they may also have a slightly different approach. Detailing what needs to be done will be sufficient.

All in all, a handover note should not be much longer than three to four pages at most. Any vital documents and files should be attached and clarified."
1,"If you click here you will be taken to a search results page. The very first listed result is also the best - if you click where it says 'handover notes' you will then open a document that explains the format of a handover note in detail, and if you scroll to the bottom of this you will come to a template that you can copy and use for your own note."
1,"1. The reasons why users need to format their hard disk drive are that they want to free up more space so that they can make good use of it, or they want to remove some errors which happen on the hard disk drive. As we mentioned above, formatting will not remove or erase the data on the hard disk drive forever. But this is based on which formatting method you are using. Basic formatting is the normal one which can be seen or be used in daily life. This operation only deletes some useless information on partition but will not lead to any data loss situation. But the low level will make data loss happen, but don't worry too much-normal users seldom use this kind of formatting method.
2. If users have backup of files, they can easily solve data loss problem which is caused by formatting. But if not, users have to recover lost files by using data recovery software.
3. Backup is one of the best methods to protect files from data loss problem. So just back up the files regularly on a storage device or on cloud service.
Data recovery is a process in which a software is used to retrieve inaccessible data from a storage device such as a hard drive, memory card, pen drive, etc. Retrieval of data may have to be done if the hard drive crashes suddenly, the data is automatically deleted due to a virus, unknowingly deleted by yourself, or the files are corrupted. The primary task of data recovery software is to scan the storage medium to find lost files. Data recovery software has several different recovery algorithms, including Undelete Protected Data, Quick Scan and Deep Scan. It will run through them one at a time until your lost data is found.
Here is a list of best data recovery softwares that I have found:
1. UFlysoft  www.uflysoft.com/data-recovery-mac/
2. Recuva
3. Disk Drill https://disk-drill.en.softonic.com/mac
4. Glary Undelete
5. Panda Recovery

1,"Giving a self introduction is all in the title; you should introduce yourself and also let the interviewer introduce themselves.

The best way to give a self introduction is to explain to the people you are introducing yourself to what they should know already. If this is a job or college interview, expand on the CV that they have already seen. Just tell them how you got to this place in your career and where you wish to be going forward. This will show your skills that you have written down and also the skills you possess in being able to expand on a point, as they will know that you can explain where you are and also add in a bit of personality. They will be able to see that you are more than what they have written on their piece of paper about you.

Make sure that you point out all of your good qualities and make sure that if there is anything they already know about you, you acknowledge this and make them feel comfortable that what they already believe is correct.

You should outline the reason why you are there giving this introduction, what drives you to become a part of their workplace of college. Make sure that you are always polite when talking. One of the most important things to do is not to swear and not to use any kind of slang. It's ok to use abbreviations, especially if they are abbreviations associated with their business.

Ensure that at the end of your self introduction you ask them if they have any questions for you and then that way, if you have left a stone unturned and they would like to know more, they can always ask you."

1,"Hi , how are you all doing ?, I am (name ) and then what you want to add"
1,"Aerobics are cardio based exercises, where as gym is cardio and weight training based. All of above are good for you.
 
Yoga is relaxing, strengthens the core muscles (back, stomach) and makes you supple.
 
Depends if you are a stressed person.
 
What I know is that it is good to make your body used to different types of exercises, to challenge your body,as your body can get too used to certain exercises, meaning they might not have the required effect in the long run.
 
Swimming is a very good full body exercise, as it does work the most muscles at the same time.
 
 "
1,"Above all, do the one that you take the most joy in. That's the one you'll probably stick with for the rest of your life.

Aerobics covers a lot of ground - running, biking, swimming, etc. Anything that's endurance based and gets your blood pumping can be aerobic. If one of those activities appeals to you, or you like the feeling of getting worn out doing endurance stuff, try aerobics.

Going to the gym and lifting weights will build strong muscles, but it can be hard to stay motivated. Without a class or other people working out with you (like aerobics or yoga) you can lose your motivation. But there are tons of benefits to weight training and getting stronger, and if you need more info about that visit Complete Strength Training, it's got great info about (obviously) strength training.

Yoga is normally taught in classes, giving it a social aspect, as well as having spiritual underpinnings that can be intriguing and fulfilling. Yoga can have more depth than just running or lifting, and get you working out with other people that have similar interests.

There's no best kind of workout, just whatever works for you. Whatever you choose, give it an honest try - at least a month of solid practice. That way you can find out if you really like it, or whether it's not for you.

Good luck,
Aaron"
1,"All exercises are good for health, but I prefer Aerobics and Yoga.
Yoga is an aesthetic discipline of exercise which aims to provide physical, mental and spiritual practice to relax mind and body.
Aerobics is a physical and relaxing activity used to train cardiovascular system, heart and lungs to process properly. The aim is to deliver oxygen to every part of the body.

I look forward to be a part of this company."
1,"This question (Why should I hire you) when asked at interview is often referred to as an 'ice breaker' because it is a way of getting to know you and is an 'easy' question (in some ways). So you have to deliver the information in an energetic and confident manner, whilst taking care not to oversell yourself.
Usually the interviewers will be looking for standard information, so try phrasing it along the lines of 'I think I would make a valuable contribution to your team. I am hardworking, punctual, I deliver to deadlines and I am very flxible, a good team player, but am able to make decisions and accept resonsibility for my work'. It may then be useful to elaborate on any relevant experience you may have which would be an asset to their company/organisation.
To practise your oral skills before the interview, go through questions which you think you will be asked and formulate your response to them. Then go through these aloud so that you can become more confident. After this go through them with your friends or family, so that they can help you with feedback and Good Luck!"

1,"If you ask a question, you will most likely get an answer if someone has the knowledge required to answer it.
However, there are some simple things askers can do to make it more likely they will get an answer:
Have a human avatar (it helps answerers feel like they're addressing someone, or helping someone out)
Ask the question in a clear and concise way. Some questions put people off when they are rambling and incoherent.
Don't be too specific. If you ask something like 'what is the puk code to my Samsung galaxy note with the the phone number 04882044005' - very few people will feel like they can help out.

Whereas, the answer to 'How do I find the PUK code on a Samsung?' might resonate with more people and be just as useful.
Ask something interesting.

Yes, we're here to try and help people out regardless of what the question is - but it's nice to answer interesting questions, so these will always get more attention."

1,"Unstructured interviews are so labeled because the interviewer does not enter the interview setting with a planned sequence of questions to be asked of the respondent. The objective of the unstructured interview is to bring some preliminary issues to the surface so the researcher can determine what variables need further in-depth investigation. Such situation calls for unstructured interviews with the people concerned. In order to understand to understand the situation in its totality the researcher will interview employees at several levels. In the initial stages only broad, open-ended questions would be asked and the replies to them would inform the researcher of the perceptions of individuals. The type and nature of the questions asked of the individuals might vary according to the job level and type of work done by them. For instance top and middle level managers might be asked more direct questions about their perceptions of the problem and the situation. Employees at low levels may have to be approached differently.

Clerical and other employees at lower hierarchical level may be asked broad, open-ended questions about their jobs and the work environment during the unstructured interviews. Supervisors may be asked broad questions relating to their department, the employee under their supervision and the organization."
1,"A structured interview is an interview where an interviewer has a preset group of questions that is going to be asked to
each and every candidate in the same sequence.
An unstructured interview is one where there isn't that structure. Where, interviewers are allowed to ask different
questions of different candidates based on context."
1,"Job interviews are the most important part of anybody’s career who has chosen to explore working for an organization. Attending an interview is always nerve cracking for an applicant.  There are many types of interviews conducted all over the world.
An unstructured interview can be defined as an interview which does not follow any particular format or style of questions. Even though, interviewer has some predetermined unstructured interview questions to examine the whole pattern might be changed according to the conversation with the candidate or sometimes the interview might proceed according to the candidate’s response. This kind of interview is more like a non-directive interview, and has a friendly approach to it.

1,Unstructured interviews are those interviews in which the questions are not prearranged. These types of interviews are also known as non-directive interviews. They are more informal as compared to structured interview. These types of interviews do not have any set format and they are based on the response of the interviewee. Unstructured interviews are much more casual and unrehearsed. If you want to know about the interview tips then you can kindly visit the job portal of Monster Singapore.
1,"A campus placement fair is a recent trend followed by many companies. The companies basically tie-up with one another and recruit staff at a common venue. The fair goes on for a set number of days and is beneficial to both, the recruiters and the candidates. The candidates get an opportunity to interact with the HR executives of various companies and hand in their resumes at all the stalls. The recruiters, on the other hand, get to choose among more number of candidates than any advertisement can ever attract.

The Google Company campus placement is a great opportunity for candidates to explore the placements available with a number of companies, all at one place. However, prior planning and a little research help a lot at a Google Company campus placement. The requirements include:
- Multiple resume copies
- Designed and customized web directory
- Updated corporate directory
- Formal dress code

You must be prepared to meet certain heads, as many try and interview the candidates at the campus placement venue itself. The common trend observed today is that many companies prefer wrapping up and completing all formalities at once. The procedures may differ from one employer to another, with regards to the formalities. While some may want to access the documentation first, others may insist on a personal interview. You should keep the day off and remember, 'patience is a virtue'."

1,Leesa:  Good answer.  You do need to consider the existing reading level when choosing the reading material.  Also (at least it helped me) is to keep a notebook handy and write down each word or reference that you don't know.  My 6th grade teacher claimed that if the book had no unfamiliar words it was too easy for you.

1,"Encourage your students to read selected material and then discuss it in relation to other books, movies, news items, or TV shows. Have your students make the comparison: What did they like about how each format portrayed the topic? How would they have changed a format to better match the topic? What was the message the writers intended the reader/observer to get from the material? Being able to connect what has been read to something else in their lives helps students think abstractly about the material.

1.  Content Marketing
2.  Social Media Optimization ( Google Plus,  Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn)
3.  Share press release

If anybody will do like above in particular manner and regular basis then sure you will get good results."
1,"SEO is about solving problems. Whether those problems are answering basic questions, providing services, or curing boredom; your webpage needs to be the answer to someone's query. How relevant and helpful your page is to solve the query, in a small nutshell, will determine how it’s ranked.
So be helpful. Be relevant. Not just to the humans, but help even those incredible machines over at Google need help too. So do some of the following:
Make unique content
Be original with your content. Posts like this and inbound marketing, in
general, contain much of the same answers everywhere you look. Why
should I share, read, or click on your content versus the 1,000,000
other results given in the search engine? Be different and engage your
audience in new ways.
Get backlinks
Larry Page came up with the idea for PageRank when he was at Stanford. He found that when people referenced certain peer-reviewed articles and documents for research papers, this acted as a kind of vote for that article.
In a nutshell, this is how backlinks were first counted in PageRank; the more votes you had the better your page ranked. The algorithm is much more sophisticated now and has a multitude of different ranking factors, but the core idea still remains: Get backlinks from respected and authoritative websites and you’re ranking will increase.
Target long-tail and short-tail
Ranking well for short tail will bring you a lot of traffic. Ranking well for
long-tail may bring you a lot of traffic depending on the search volume;
however, long-tail will bring more targeted traffic and result in more
conversions and less bounce-rate if your site offers them value.
Short-tail means more competition, but if you can muscle your way up the SERPs it will be great for brand awareness. If you can also rank as a Featured Snippet it can mean a bump in traffic and higher CTR in some cases.
Update your content
If you post content and notice that it’s not ranking well after a while,
then update it. Keep an eye on your competitors and let that be a
barometer of where you want to be in the SERPs and try to find things they may have missed you can add to your content to outrank them.
Run optimization checks and get feedback from users about your content to see how you can improve it.
Don’t ignore social media
While engines like Google don’t adhere to social signals as ranking factors, they can still help things like your bounce and click-through-rates to the signal that people do find value on your website.
Furthermore, the more exposure your content has, the more it can be viewed by others and possibly used in their own content.
Give high importance to Facebook Twitter and Google plus. If your content gets engaged in these sites easily, then your ranking will increase quickly and thus your website will get exposure.
For social media services regarding these sites visit SMM Boost Service.
Be patient
SEO is one of those things that takes a lot of time and energy. You ’re going to screw something up eventually, but don’t despair. Keep working hard and it will pay off eventually. Use white-hat techniques only. Black-hat may provide you with some short-term value, but the outlook long-term isn’t good as Google will catch you. They almost always catch you."

Was the message I wrote a harassing one? And what is the worst case scenario for it? Also, he jokes with me all the time but in a sense he's harassing me for it. I don't understand the NY rules completely, but could I sneak a recording sometimes when he's joking around in a harassing way? Or in general, could I sneak a recording? If I'm talking to him of course.
And one more thing, I dork with my mother and he will mess with me about that from time to time about how I'm soft or how my mom does things for me and calls me spoiled for it. Could I right there tell him to shut up?

1,"I am so sorry. Putting an animal to sleep is one of the hardest and one of the kindest things to do. It takes putting your beloved pet's well being and comfort above your desire to hold them. There is no doubt that time is going to be their biggest help in dealing with the loss.
I have had to put one dog down. I knew it was coming, so that helped prepare me. But afterwards the thing that helped me most was talking about the silly things he did. I was laughing and crying at the same time. So maybe have everyone talk about their favorite memories. 
Another is to look for signs that the bunny may send to let her now it is ok. Some people say seeing a cardinal is a sign of a some who has passed is checking in. Or maybe if the bunny liked munching on dandelions, one pops up . You know something that would be special to the bunny. The night after I had to put my boy Thor to sleep, Arabella and I were in bed and she started snoring. She NEVER snores. Thor ALWAYS snored. I knew that a sign that Thor was ok.
Hugs to you and your family."

1,I'm sorry Yin. Give her a big hug and let her know her bunny is not in pain anymore.
1,"I m so sorry for your loss.
Just tell her how much u love her, and u know how much she loved bunny. It would help for her to know that bunny loved her and showed this love by not being afraid.
Remind her of all the cute things bunny would do.
Mention how u feel abt bunnys loss.
After that, it will take a lot of time.
Find ppl who have also had to put their animal down. You love them all, regardless of wether its a cat, a dog, a horse or a bunny."

Hippy game me great advice once when he talked about a little family memorial service. Have a little service for him with all who loved him so, talk about him, maybe eat his favorite human foods. Have the kids friends come over if they have some memory to talk about and want to. Maybe a little memorial out in the backyard. A stone or a special rock. Whatever speaks to your daughter. Just throwing out some suggestions. Everyone has their own ideas on those rituals. A celebration of his life and the joy he brought you and your daughter,, a little acknowledgement, a respectful tribute to a critter who brought your family all that he did.
Hugs to you and your family, Yin."

But I of course love it since it's helping me lose weight easier but can you tell me what that is and called. Also, is there any side effects if I continue to lose weight with it?"
0,"You are negatively programming yourself to not eat sugar rather than positively encouraging yourself to be healthier in your food choices,  the messages you give yourself affect your mood and your body.  Losing weight doesn't mean depriving yourself of little amounts of what you enjoy, it means maintaining a balance.

web design services Dubai has to
offer, and they are effective enough to take your website from zero to hero,
with time. The tips are as follows
1.

a large group of audience, and several keywords, thereby causing spamming and
wastage of budget. But, if you were to invest in SEO services that any web design company Dubai has to offer,

building done through useful blogs, and proper linking will aid in making your
business genuine on the internet.
5.
Creative Advertising – if the
SMS, emailers, and other buzzing modes of reaching out are implemented
creatively, you will not appear as spam."
1,"Spam can be defined as irrelevant or unsolicited messages sent over the Internet. These are usually sent to a large number of users for a variety of use cases such as advertising, phishing, spreading malware, etc.
In the past, spam used to favor email as it was the primary communication tool. Email addresses were relatively easy to harvest via chat rooms, websites, customer lists and that impact a user’s address book. Eventually, email filters became more sophisticated, and more effectively decreased spam from clogging the inbox.
Since then, spammers have moved onto a new target: Social applications.
Fake accounts are key to social spamming: To gain credibility, these fake accounts will try to become ‘friends’ or follow verified accounts, e.g., celebrities and public figures with the hope that these accounts befriend or follow them back. When genuine accounts befriend or follow back fake accounts, it legitimizes the account and enables it to carry out spam activities.
Another way for spammers to attack is to hack into and take over a user’s account, spreading fake messages to the user’s authentic followers.

1,"A person who has embarked upon the Hajj pilgrimage is known as a hajji or hajjah. A hajji is honoured in his or her community. For many people, the thought of being respected amongst the other members of his or her community prompts them to perform the Hajj. The term hajji, in fact, is translated as honourable pilgrim in the English language.

Hajj, according to the teachers of Islamic religious studies, is an expression of one's devotion to God and not a means to gain a higher status in society. This sentiment is reflected by a prayer which is known as the talbiyah prayer. The faithful should examine his or her beliefs and intentions before performing the pilgrimage and constantly strive for self-improvement. In spite of suffering a lot of physical hardships, the pilgrims who complete the Hajj successfully consider it to be one of the greatest spiritual experiences of their lives."

1,"There are many main differences between living in an apartment and a living in a house. A house is usually on the ground floor and has an upstairs and a downstairs. In a house, there is normally (but not always) a kitchen, dining room and living room downstairs, whilst the bedrooms and bathroom are upstairs. In an apartment, which is usually in a block, so raised above ground level, all of the rooms of the house are on the same floor (unless the flat has a mezzanine level).

Apartments can often be as expensive, if not more expensive than houses. Houses often come with garages, where as apartments can usually only come with a parking space. Houses often have gardens out the front and out the back. The size of the gardens depends on the size of the property itself. To some people, apartment living is a more stylish and less traditional than house dwelling. In major cities, apartments are often city dwellings whereas houses are the located in the suburbs."
1,"I don't think there aren't any big difference in these two except maybe for comfort. Normally apartment is smaller than a typical house. It can be a 2-storey adjacent flats or a flat within a building. The not so good about living in an apartment is that, your home is only separated by walls and your unit is side by side so basically you can hear noise from your neighbours. While house is commonly understood as a detached unit. Depends on the size, there is more room for privacy too."
1,"House is bigger apartment is smaller
apartments are rented or leased
apartments usaly have other people living there
houses are quiter"
1,"Not exactly sure what you are asking.
But:
Houses can be rented just like apartments.
Some houses are smaller than some apartments.
There are many apartments on the ground floor unless the building has a ground floor reserved for commercial enterprises.
Not all houses have an upstairs and a downstairs."
1,Houses are your qwn propertyand you have to manitain of your own and thats your permanent place.But apartment you rent it for shorter time and is also smaller in size than the houses.
1,"Normally a house is bigger than an apartment which situate in the town more than in the suburb, I like to live in a house, because it's more spaces and comfortable for doing somethings, inviting people or hold a party etc... There's also a garden where we can plant some flowers, fruits and vegetables etc... So for me I can find many things to do there."
1,"There is huge difference between living in a house or living in an apartment .Apartment are rent But house is your own property.. In house there is common like rooms are individually bedrooms, bathroom,Kitchen, Dining room and lobby . In an apartment there is single block involves all rooms... House are bigger than apartments."
1,You have a vested financial interest in a home and only rent an apartment.  You can do pretty much what you want to renovate or maintain your home .. But have to get permission from your landlord to make changes or improvements to an apartment.
1,"Living in an apartment, I don't have to worry about lawn maintenance, and if something breaks down, I call the office and they fix it. I also do not have a water/sewage bill, nor do I have to worry about getting the garbage to the curb on pick-up day. The only big disadvantage is sometimes the neighbors can be a bit loud."
1,"Leaving
a house is the fully personal area where you have own garden and all
the other thing in a house like bedroom, guest room kitchen etc. These
all things are yours. But an apartment is different from the house in an apartment, there are many people living in a single building you have only specific area is given to live."
1,"Firstly, there is obviously a major difference in size. When you have more space, you will have enough room to accommodate each and every single one of your needs and others living in the house with you. However, it would also mean that you will have a high tendency of owning more items which could cause a clutter if cleaning is not done on a regular basis."
1,"Hi
there! I lived in houses for most of my life, apart from the time when I was
studying in London. Apartment-living will be more restrictive in various ways
and one will also have to get used to being closer to neighbours and be able to
respect them all. On the other hand, a house will often come with fencing all
around, a back and front garden and it will be more spacious in general. This
will obviously be more convenient if you have a larger family and you will also
have more freedom."
1,"Some of us prefer to live in an apartment
whereas some other love to live in a house. Living in a house or an apartment
is just a matter of preference and can change from person to person.  However, there are few important benefits that

And you want to be part of professionals. And you like working in a professional environment doing more challenging jobs."
1,Because I am interested in the organization and want to have an outstanding achievement in the organization.
1,"This is the most basic and most important question asked by the interviewer in any interview. Here these points are help you to answer the question confidently.
Learn about your career goals and how this position fits into your plan
Make sure that you are sincerely interested in the job and will be motivated to perform if hired
Find out what you know about the company, industry, position (and if you took the time to research)
Understand your priorities and preferences — which aspects of the company and/or job are appealing to you and why?
A good answer will demonstrate a knowledge of the company and industry. That means you must do your homework so that you can identify specific reasons for wanting to work for the firm.
These reasons could include one or several of the following:
Company general reputation
Reputation of key leaders
Admiration of products/services
Admiration of other company initiatives (marketing campaign, community involvement, training programs)
Company awards
Company management philosophy
Company values
Company positioning in market
Company growth/success
It is not enough to have solid answers only for the above questions. You need to be prepared for the full spectrum of questions that may be presented. For further practice, make sure you go through the required mock interview in online. I would like to suggest InterviewBuddy-https://interviewbuddy.in/ is the best website to practice and prepare the interview with experts in real-time."

Then dress appropriately for the interview and remember the maxim ""first impression is the best impression"".

Then it might move on to the more specific details as to why are looking for a change and some other queries which would help them to determine your knowledge and skills. Answer them confidently and be honest and clear. Do not try to show off or try to be something that you are not. Be yourself and do not be afraid of making mistakes. Though it is bad to make mistakes it is worse to have a bad attitude. Thus it does not require any extraordinary skills to get through an HR interview."

1,"Hiring cleaning services should be done meticulously. You need to be sure that you are actually hiring credible folks to work in your home. You cannot just allow any kind of person to come into your home, can you? Besides, you should ensure that the cleaners are really going to offer you a great and invaluable service. Evaluate their service, their portfolio and what they stand for and make sure that they are really the best around with respect to your budget and needs.
If you are poised at hiring the best home cleaners, these checklists will guide your steps on the right path and help you not to fall into a ditch.
Do They Offer a Satisfaction Guarantee?
Satisfaction guarantee is simply a way a service provider proves that he offers services that would satisfy the customer. With a satisfaction guarantee, you can be sure that the cleaning service is worth it and you can confidently put in your money. In some cases, the cleaning company will refund you if you are not satisfied with the service. This means that you will not lose your money in the process. You can confidently leverage such a service.
Do they hire contract workers or have full-time employees?
This may not seem necessary, but it is really important. You are safer in the hands of companies that have full-time employees but you should be wary of those that hire contract workers. Companies spend significantly lower amounts of money in hiring contract workers. The contract workers are replaceable and they know it; this makes it very difficult for them to be dedicated to the job but this is not the case with full-time employees.
Be sure of the cleaners you are hiring
Before hiring cleaning services, MN, you need to really be sure of the cleaners you are hiring. Remember that your home is your most sacred space and you cannot afford to let any kind of person in the home. This makes it important to properly study the person or people you are hiring to be sure that they worth the risk. Go through the company’s references, ensure that a background check is run on the workers and make sure that the workers do not have any criminal records.
Get Your Own Cleaning Supplies
Some cleaning companies have their own cleaning supplies, but some others do not. However, whether the cleaning company would come with their cleaning supplies or not, it is usually better to have your own cleaning supplies. This is very important if you are considering the safety and health of your home. Most importantly, you should be critical of the cleaning solution used by the company. You can get a green cleaning solution before hiring the company and ensure that the company uses the cleaning solution. This will keep you on a safer side and prevent any odd circumstance from occurring.
By following these checklists, you can ensure that you hire the best cleaning services.

1,"My dad's still in the hospital but the doctors say his kidneys are stable as of yesterday. Here is my dilemma... My dad wants to sign himself out against medical advice (AMA) He says if i dont get him out of there he will crawl out Monday. I dont blame him, however on one side a cat scan shows (the doctor thinks) my dad had a mini stroke when he was home. He wants to run some more tests. My dad can not eat because everything burns his esophagus. He swallows water and ice just fine. Its not a swallowing problem. He hasn't eaten since December 31st and the dr wont give him nutrients through the IV because of his kidneys. I managed to get him to eat a yogurt and half of a nutrient filled fruit drink. For about two weeks he hasn't been able to walk. About a week he can't stand. I am working on helping him sit and stand right now. If he comes home I don't have the confidence in myself that I could care correctly for his chest catheter they put in for dialysis or the wound on his foot. I fear ""what if"" he falls out of bed being so weak still. On the other hand... I fear leaving him in the care of the hospital when I'm not there. So far I have caught 2 MAJOR mistakes 1 being another patients name on my dad's medicine (yes I checked the medicine was correct, just the patient was mixed up) and another time the nurse swore my dad had his oxygen on after he came back from a procedure. It didn't look on to me. She said no it's on. I said okay?.... Then she actually checked to see if it was on and IT WAS TURNED OFF! I don't know how long he was with out the oxygen! It caught my attention because his o2 numbers on the blood pressure machine was beeping and I noticed it beeped everytime it went below 90! They didnt catch the beep OR the oxygen being off! Yesterday when I went to see him (I was able to go an hour and a half after a phone call from the dr.) He sat in poop for an hour THAT I KNOW OF! Then his nurse lied to me saying she just checked him and changed him when he was sitting in the chair 45 mins before I showed up and he was fine. She did not know that THAT was the reason why the doctor called me... Because dad was refusing to sit in the chair for him.... I spoke to the Dr AFTER the chair and an hour and a half BEFORE I got there! She did not have him checked and tended to while in the chair 45 mins prior because then WHY would the Dr call me saying he is refusing to sit in a chair and he can't release him till he does!

1,"That's a tough one, Yin
Personally, I never had to parent my parents---and quite frankly, I probably would not have been able to do so successfully on my own due to the dynamics in my nuclear family before I left for college.
It's important to have options. Would a transfer to another hospital for treatment be possible?
Beyond that, I fear I have no useful advice.
If you have a few minutes to stop thinking about it, asking JC to help you arrange your thoughts in an approppriate way for evaluation usually works well for me."

1,"If you don't have a POA (Durable Power of Attorney) then there isn't a lot you can do on their behalf.
I went through this with both my father and just recently with my Father-in-Law. The problem is they get to the point where they still think they are fully cognitive and capable of making decisions regarding their own health and finances. It is important to for these discussion to happen long before you get to a point where you end up having to fight for ability to help your parent.
Currently, my Mother-in-Law has a nurse come in to check on her once a day. To get her up, and start the day, but my wife and I have to take care of her finances and get her to doctor's visits and grocery shop (for prepared foods because she can barely run a microwave).
This is not the best place to be in but you will make it through. If anything it has shown my wife and I that we need to have things in place long before we get to that point in our lives for our children."

1,"I'm starting to lose weight but what motivates me to doing it. Is by thinking of a reason of what gives me doubt and it makes it easier of avoiding sugar and eating healthy but if I do eat sugar or something sweet I lose that motivation it feels like it's in my stomach and it feels like a dark doubt. But I of course love it since it's helping me lose weight easier but can you tell me what that is and called. Also, is there any side effects if I continue to lose weight with it?"
0,"You are negatively programming yourself to not eat sugar rather than positively encouraging yourself to be healthier in your food choices,  the messages you give yourself affect your mood and your body.  Losing weight doesn't mean depriving yourself of little amounts of what you enjoy, it means maintaining a balance.  If you treat yourself in this way you are in essense bullying yourself and no one likes to be bullied. I guess your are feeling this doom and gloom programming in your gut."

1,"Campus interviews can be nerve-racking. It may be the first time you have seen the college or university for the first time - so besides new surroundings you are dealing with lots of questions! Remember, however, that college and university representatives may want to impress you as much as you want to impress them.

A campus interview is a chance for the institution to present itself to students. Therefore, a campus interview is not only about sharing information about yourself. It is also an opportunity to learn about the college or university. This simple fact may put you more at ease.

To prepare, do some research about the university or college and try to see how you would fit in. What could you bring to the university or college? Also try to articulate to yourself what your goals and dreams are for the future. Universities and colleges like nothing better than when their graduates succeed in the world, advertising their alma mater in the process."
1,"First check out the companies you're about to attend.Then collect all the previous placement papers of those companies.Then practice for those type of questions.Mostly you'll have objective type of questions where in you have to select the answer from given options.Practice well on Aptitude part as it carries more importance.Buy a 'Agarwal' Book if your in INDIA.Else practice on following type of problems:

*)Time and Distance

*)Ages

*)Time and Work

*)Percentages

*)Profit Loss,etc..

Then have some idea of answering questions based on verbal and comprehension where in you need to answer questions which are based on the paragraph given above.You have to read those paragraph answer those questions.Also look for Synonyms and Antonyms.For that you can refer the

""GRE preparation by Barrons"".

Also prepare for Logical questions
All The Best !"
1,"The concept of 'campus' or campus placement is relatively recent in origin, but very beneficial to the recruiters and candidates alike. The candidates get an opportunity to access every possible job opportunity they qualify for. The recruiters, on the other hand, get to meet and interact with more candidates than most of their offices could ever accommodate or any classified could attract.

It is important for a candidate to be well informed about such placement opportunities, well in time. The announcements are made in newspapers, on television, the cable or the radio. However, most aspirants find out about the 'fairs' from friends. It is essential to indulge in a little research prior to visiting the venue. You need to get together certain documents and update information. You need to identify your basic skills and vocational pursuit. You can't end up looking confused at an offer or procrastinate. You also need to highlight on paper and verbally, your academic qualifications and career planning goals. Always keep in mind that most of the opportunities would require you to present your best at one shot. There is little or no time to prepare once you are there. Carry along many copies of your resume and try and gather as much information as you can about the companies present at the venue. This would give you a chance to customize your approach.

Never forget to take along your self-esteem and confidence. They are your most valuable assets."
1,"The interview questions are based on your subject skills. The interviewer will check your technical skills and communication skills, moreover confidence levels. Before attending the interview you can practice interview questions through some career guidance websites or practice mock interview in real-time. But, I prefer online mock interviews because practical knowledge is better than theoretical knowledge.
As my suggestion, online practice interviews are the best way to practice the interviews. It will help to boost your confidence for the actual interview. I would like to suggest InterviewBuddy-(Online mock interviews with experts) is the best online platform to practice any stream of an interview and you can get industry experts feedback. It will help to know the actual interview process and questions."
1,To attend campus interviews confidently visit www.tipsoninterview.com  and read interview tips prepared by experts.
1,You should refer to sites like www.chetanasinterview.com and www.freshersworld.com/a> and refer aptitude books like that by R.S.AGGARWAL and verbal from BARRONS.
1,"The best way to prepare for a technical or HR interview is to try to determine what types of questions a potential employer may ask you and how you would formulate your response to these questions. You should never attend any interview without having at least a minimal degree of preparation. Even if you are not sure what you will be asked, be certain to find out a little about the company you are interested in working for and, when appropriate, try to weave in bits of information about the company into your answers. This will show that you are prepared, truly interested and can take the initiative.

For HR interviews, expect to be asked about your previous work experience and what you have learned from this, as well as your specific skills. If you are just out of university, talk about internships you may have taken, as well as any volunteer work. Be sure to mention that you have good technical writing skills and that you are able to prepare technical reports and presentations with ease. These are key to most HR jobs."
1,Very formal clothing
1,I would wear  nice silky pants suit.
1,"I will wear a skirt suite,stockings and shoes"
1,"Men’s Interview Attire:
SUIT:
Light Colored Jacket and Pants
Wear a simple shirt collar, such as a traditional straight point or a slightly less dressy button-down, avoiding tab collars, pins or wide English spreads. Also avoid monograms or jaunty contrasting white-collar-and-cuffs. And no French cuffs, which will help you avoid any cuff link mistakes.
TIE:
The tie is extremely important, since it is the first thing someone notices in a man’s outfit. An all-over, neat pattern, a small dot or a classic stripe all work well. Avoid anything wild, overly bright or statement-making.
Ties with simple repeating patterns can be good for a job interview as long as those patterns are as simple as possible.
KNOT:
A knot type to use on an interview will depend on a shirt collar you chose, as well as on the type of the tie and your own face structure.
SHOES:
black lace-up shoes are far better than casual penny loafers or anything gimmicky with buckles or straps. Never underestimate the importance of a good shoeshine. And black socks only, ones that are long enough to cover your ankles if you cross your legs but not bulky.
The shoes should be neat and well-polished.
SOCKS:
1.Your socks should match the trousers and/or shoes and be possibly solid and dark in color. The rule of thumb here is that socks must not draw people’s attention.
JEWELRY:
When it comes to jewelry, the main thing to remember is that the simpler and less of it – the better. Wedding rings, of course, are always acceptable.
WATCH:
Avoid wearing digital, sporty watches, as well as those overwhelmed with various dial plates, huge tachymeters, world time zone plates etc.
It is better to use a watch with a leather band, but in the United States a metal one is acceptable too.
BELT:
A belt should be made of leather and match the color and possibly the quality of leather on your shoes.
HAIR:
Trimmed and freshly combed hair.
No Spikes
NAILS:
Nails should be clean.
Fragrance:
A very little of cologne can be okay. Do not apply too much of it for an interviewer not to suffocate if in a small room, where you might be interviewed. Anyway, it is still advised to use some neutral-smell.
Women’s Interview Attire:
Pick something classy if you don't wear a suit:
Pick a suit that fits you well and isn't too flashy. Stick to darker colors
Clean and iron your outfit.
Conservative shoes:
Don't pick something you can't walk in. If you don't like heels, stick to something low and basic.
Don't wear too much jewelry:
Keep it simple. For instance, a small chain and a pair of smallish earrings. In addition, don't wear too many rings.
No jewelry is better than cheap jewelry.
Don't go overboard on makeup:
Go for a more natural look, and don't go overboard on designs or colors.
Pick a natural, neutral concealer to hide flaws, followed by a neutral powder to help take care of shininess. Use blush that goes with your complexion; usually warm pink or peach is a good choice.
For your eyes, a light brown or one slightly darker than your skin tone can add dimension without looking like you're wearing eye shadow. You can use eyeliner, but try light gray and just lightly dot it on your upper eyelid.
Finally, choose a lipstick or lip tint that is basically the same color as your lips.
Keep all of it light. Basically, you want to look like you're not actually wearing makeup, but you want to even out your skin tone and add a bit of color.
Professional hairstyle:
Simple hairstyles are better.
Perfume:
A very little of cologne can be okay. Do not apply too much of it for an interviewer not to suffocate if in a small room, where you might be interviewed. Anyway, it is still advised to use some neutral-smell.
Nails:
Neatly manicured clean nails
Carry a briefcase:
1. If you have important papers to carry, don't forget to add a professional-looking briefcase. Use a dark color, and try to pick one that's more modern. Leather is always a nice choice.

1,"My dad's still in the hospital but the doctors say his kidneys are stable as of yesterday. Here is my dilemma... My dad wants to sign himself out against medical advice (AMA) He says if i dont get him out of there he will crawl out Monday. I dont blame him, however on one side a cat scan shows (the doctor thinks) my dad had a mini stroke when he was home. He wants to run some more tests. My dad can not eat because everything burns his esophagus. He swallows water and ice just fine. Its not a swallowing problem. He hasn't eaten since December 31st and the dr wont give him nutrients through the IV because of his kidneys. I managed to get him to eat a yogurt and half of a nutrient filled fruit drink. For about two weeks he hasn't been able to walk. About a week he can't stand. I am working on helping him sit and stand right now. If he comes home I don't have the confidence in myself that I could care correctly for his chest catheter they put in for dialysis or the wound on his foot. I fear ""what if"" he falls out of bed being so weak still. On the other hand... I fear leaving him in the care of the hospital when I'm not there. So far I have caught 2 MAJOR mistakes 1 being another patients name on my dad's medicine (yes I checked the medicine was correct, just the patient was mixed up) and another time the nurse swore my dad had his oxygen on after he came back from a procedure. It didn't look on to me. She said no it's on. I said okay?.... Then she actually checked to see if it was on and IT WAS TURNED OFF! I don't know how long he was with out the oxygen! It caught my attention because his o2 numbers on the blood pressure machine was beeping and I noticed it beeped everytime it went below 90! They didnt catch the beep OR the oxygen being off! Yesterday when I went to see him (I was able to go an hour and a half after a phone call from the dr.) He sat in poop for an hour THAT I KNOW OF! Then his nurse lied to me saying she just checked him and changed him when he was sitting in the chair 45 mins before I showed up and he was fine. She did not know that THAT was the reason why the doctor called me... Because dad was refusing to sit in the chair for him.... I spoke to the Dr AFTER the chair and an hour and a half BEFORE I got there! She did not have him checked and tended to while in the chair 45 mins prior because then WHY would the Dr call me saying he is refusing to sit in a chair and he can't release him till he does! Grrrrr! What would you do.... Try to convince him to stay? Or be his ride home on his own AMA? How do you tell your parent no?

So If you want to go with it, empty you closet of all the cotton/polyester clothes you have, and throw out the multigrain bread you have.  Oh and also no more shrimp or lobster for you either. Shellfish is a no-no as well. The bible also says slavery is okay. All of this is in the first testament. Jesus never said anything about homosexuality, but he did say we should love one another."
0,"These are positions you should decide for yourself, as you must be aware, what we might think about other people and their life choices has no bearing on them. 
Belief is the practice of accepting without evidence, following the ideals of others. In this case, you cite scripture, but choose to honor only certain bits of the whole (Gator Blu gave good examples). That you choose to live this way in your faith is as small a matter to others as is your stance on their personal preferences.  
Shoe on the other foot: What of others' opinions of your Catholicism, does it bother you that there are those who find fault with this? Would you have them impose their positions on you?
Food for thought..."
1,"If you are a believer then leave it up to God. 
Here is some food for thought...
Homosexuality practices were often associated with Pagan Temples of other gods which maybe why it is classed as an abomination in the bible. God saw the body of a person as a temple of God.  That a child can only come from male and female union.
Many pagan religions still believed intercourse had to be between a man and a woman as this signified the earth and heaven union.
Your bible states that woman came from man. In Jewish Midrash, Adam was both male and female, therefore Eve was taken from Adams side, hence why a woman must be joined to a man in marriage or sexual union in order to become one flesh.
The Catholic Church had many priests who committed abominable acts with children over many years, and have still not held those accountable, but just moving them to different areas of the church, I don't think it can stand in judgement of others.
Homosexuality and even paedophiler was permitted or ignored in Rome.  Socrates was a pederast. Hence, homosexuality may have an unfortunate stigma of being associated with paedophiler due to history.
Not all homosexuals engage in sodomy.
If your children were homosexual would you love them any less?"
1,"The Bible was written as a guide, not a rule book. Let your heart be your guide and believe what's in it, not what was written thousands of years ago."
1,"I am a Catholic (cradle, now 71 years old), so let me take a shot at this.
When I was a teenager and young adult, homosexuality carried quite a societal stigma.  I have always been heterosexual, and that was well buttressed during my upbringing by the extant dislike (more like disgust, I fear) of homosexuals.
I was always taught ""Hate the sin, lover the sinner,"" so I always had a way to separate the 16 year old who stole the package of gum from the store and the 16 year old active homosexual from what they did and still ""love"" them in the general way that adolescents can sort of understand that concept. 
I have had a great and sustained interest in theology and psychology since I studied both formally.  I was also abused as a child (NOT sexually) and that has always tended to make me want to understand the motivations of those who perform actions that for whatever reason are judged (whether rightly or wrongly) harshly by the society in which they live.
Bottom line---for years, I have actively sought to wrap my mind around homosexuality.  About four years ago, I realized that it was highly unlikely that I would ever be able to do so, so I told God (literally) that I thought that perhaps homosexuality was not something I needed to understand.
And if you can't understand something, it's hard to have an informed personal opinion about it.
So, here is my present approach to homosexuality---currently I do not have a personal opinion on it, nor do I have a responsibility to formulate one at present.
Beyond realizing that homosexuality in and of itself does not assure the continuation of the species, I do not understand how it fits into anyone’s daily life, but  I certainly do not fear homosexuality.  Interacting with homosexuals as fellow humans is easy---after all, I’m human too.  As to other questions, e.g., morality and legality, I leave that dialogue to those in the appropriate fields.
Love is an act we perform.  The genital component of love is a separate issue.  So are ""feelings.""  (Just a heads up for understanding.)"
0,"I was going to make a point similar to Gator Blu, but I believed she expressed it better than I would have.
If you decide to believe that homosexuality is wrong anyways, I want to encourage you to be respectful of gay people anyways and act like a decent person. While you don't have to agree you still have to respect them and leave them alone regarding it.
When I was still religious, I was also homophobic, it was actually this flowchart that changed my mind about it:"
1,"So, as a believer, do you embrace ALL the teachings of the Bible?
There are some that hold the Ten Commandments in high regard (both Sets with second one being very odd), and then there are some that attribute Eating Shellfish, Bacon, getting your hair cut with rounded edges, Beard Cut, Mixing fabrics (Poly/cotton blends included) and wearing jewelry to be part of Mosaic Law, and not relevant to us now . . . Both are from the Old Testament, and the Commandments (including Thou shalt not kill, and Thou shalt love no other God before me) are just as much part of Mosaic Law.
If anything, the Christian ""Belief System"" tolerance has had to adapt (Yes Evolve) to mold itself to CURRENT Cultural norms. Often, those who are against things like homosexuality, have made this a ""Personal Preference"" with regards to their subjective World View. They only use the Religious text that most closely align with what THEY feel is appropriate behavior and disregard the parts they do not personally agree with.
In the end, you get to decide. You can maintain your belief system, and only regard the scripture that aligns with your World view, and disregard the rest as tired Old text relevant only to the day and age of its creation."
1,Megan I am also catholic and I have nothing wrong with that and if that's what you believe then I think its alright. Your right. With all people being themselves . I don't see anything wrong with that at all.
1,As a Catholic it's not your place to judge others God loves all of mankind and all of mankind sins. In the Popes first year he was asked about a certain gay priest in the Vatican and the Pope replied who am I to judge them awesome answer.
1,"It is sad that people who claim to be Christian love and accept what God clearly said is wrong not only in Leviticus 18:22, ""You must not lie down with a male in the same way that you lie down with a woman. It is a detestable act.""  Also in the New Testament at 1CORINTHIANS 6:9-11 says ""Or do you not know that unrighteous people will not inherit God's Kingdom? Do not be misled. Those who are sexually immoral,idolaters,adulterers,men who submit to homosexual acts,men who practice homosexuality, thieves,greedy people,drunkards,revilers,and extortioners will not inherit God's Kingdom.  And yet that is what some of you were. But you have been washed clean; you have been sanctified; you have been declared righteous in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and with the spirit of God.""  Even though it is an accepted practice in the world today it is not with God. The Bible was written for all people no matter what time period they have lived on earth."
0,"Dear Megan,
I find this question very interesting as well as the
comments that have been posted.  Since
you are a devout Catholic, I’m sure you view the Bible as God’s Word.  So, to truly get the answer to your question,
you will have to decide how much do you trust God’s Word and what is written in
it.  Many of the answers posted have been
based on how society views homosexuality, but as we all know public opinion
changes.  What is accepted today may not
be that way tomorrow.  But the Bible has
not changed on its stance about homosexuality, no matter how ones may try to
change the view of the matter.  At 1 Corinthians
6:9, 10 helps us to appreciate God’s view; Or do you not know that unrighteous people
will not inherit God’s Kingdom? Do not be misled. Those who are sexually
immoral, idolaters, adulterers, men who submit to homosexual acts, men who
practice homosexuality, 10 thieves, greedy people,
drunkards, revilers, and extortioners will not inherit God’s Kingdom.
We all remember the
account in book of Genesis the 19th chapter about Lot and what took
place in Sodom and Gomorrah.  We do well
to remember that these 2 cities were destroyed because of their unhealthy
appetite of homosexuality.  Lot even
offered his virgin daughters in place of the men (who were angels in the flesh)
but the men, all the way from young boy to old man refused and demanded that
the men be brought out so they could have sex with them. 
For those who may
say that the old testament of the Bible is outdated, this proves to be false
because God does not change on how He views matters that He considers a sin.  2 Timothy 3:16 helps us to see that: “All Scripture is inspired of God and
beneficial for teaching, for reproving, for setting things straight, for
disciplining in righteousness, so that the man of God may be fully competent,
completely equipped for every good work.”
So, Megan if you
trust in what the Bible says and not the view of man, you should be able to
make a well conscience decision on how you will view homosexuality and whether it is right or wrong."

I dont blame him, however on one side a cat scan shows (the doctor thinks) my dad had a mini stroke when he was home. He wants to run some more tests. My dad can not eat because everything burns his esophagus. He swallows water and ice just fine. Its not a swallowing problem. He hasn't eaten since December 31st and the dr wont give him nutrients through the IV because of his kidneys. I managed to get him to eat a yogurt and half of a nutrient filled fruit drink. For about two weeks he hasn't been able to walk. About a week he can't stand. I am working on helping him sit and stand right now. If he comes home I don't have the confidence in myself that I could care correctly for his chest catheter they put in for dialysis or the wound on his foot.

1,"Q ""What does it mean when a minister shares bible verses with a women?""
Errmmm... The ""women"" does one half of the verse and the minister does the other half?
For example if the verse is 1 Corinthians 11:6 “For if the woman be not
covered, let her also be shorn: But if it be a shame for a woman to be shorn or
shaven, let her be covered.” then the ""women"" does the uncovering and the minister does the shaving?

1,"The most important types of chain polymerization are radical polymerization, ionic polymerization, and insertion or coordination polymerization. Three steps characterize each method of polymerization. The start reaction or initiation, the growth reaction, and the termination reaction. The first reaction step, i.e. The initiation, is the formation of a reactive radical or ion9. This requires, in general higher activation energy than the subsequent growth reaction in which the monomers add to the growing chain. Consequently the growth rate is very much higher than the rate of initiation.    Nomer is activated and opened up so that it can for new bonds and then after the reaction with another monomer it becomes saturated e.g. Ethylene becomes –CH2-CH2–  Bi-functional monomers polymerize into linear chain molecules and a thermoplastic material is obtained. Monomer with two functional groups results in cross linked polymers, such as thermosets and elastomers. The termination step can occur either by two growing polymer chains combining with each other in radical polymerization or by addition of a terminating agent or a modifier whose function is to combine with the reactive end of the growing chain and thus saturate its reactivity. Modifying or termination agents can be by products or impurities or specifically added substance that reacts with the reactive end of the growing chains."
1,Chain-growth polymerization or chain polymerization is a polymerization technique where unsaturated monomer molecules add onto the active site of a growing polymer chain one at a time. Growth of the polymer occurs only at one (or possibly more) ends. Addition of each monomer unit regenerates the active site. Pls visit@ www.iiscm.org/
1,It is characterized by the self addition of monomer molecules to each other very rapidly through a chain. Their is no by product formed. The product is of same elemental composition as that of monomers. In chain polymerization bi functionality is provided due to the presence of double bond.
1,"My dad's still in the hospital but the doctors say his kidneys are stable as of yesterday. Here is my dilemma... My dad wants to sign himself out against medical advice (AMA) He says if i dont get him out of there he will crawl out Monday. I dont blame him, however on one side a cat scan shows (the doctor thinks) my dad had a mini stroke when he was home. He wants to run some more tests. My dad can not eat because everything burns his esophagus. He swallows water and ice just fine. Its not a swallowing problem. He hasn't eaten since December 31st and the dr wont give him nutrients through the IV because of his kidneys. I managed to get him to eat a yogurt and half of a nutrient filled fruit drink. For about two weeks he hasn't been able to walk. About a week he can't stand. I am working on helping him sit and stand right now. If he comes home I don't have the confidence in myself that I could care correctly for his chest catheter they put in for dialysis or the wound on his foot. I fear ""what if"" he falls out of bed being so weak still. On the other hand... I fear leaving him in the care of the hospital when I'm not there. So far I have caught 2 MAJOR mistakes 1 being another patients name on my dad's medicine (yes I checked the medicine was correct, just the patient was mixed up) and another time the nurse swore my dad had his oxygen on after he came back from a procedure. It didn't look on to me. She said no it's on. I said okay?.... Then she actually checked to see if it was on and IT WAS TURNED OFF! I don't know how long he was with out the oxygen! It caught my attention because his o2 numbers on the blood pressure machine was beeping and I noticed it beeped everytime it went below 90! They didnt catch the beep OR the oxygen being off! Yesterday when I went to see him (I was able to go an hour and a half after a phone call from the dr.) He sat in poop for an hour THAT I KNOW OF! Then his nurse lied to me saying she just checked him and changed him when he was sitting in the chair 45 mins before I showed up and he was fine. She did not know that THAT was the reason why the doctor called me... Because dad was refusing to sit in the chair for him.... I spoke to the Dr AFTER the chair and an hour and a half BEFORE I got there! She did not have him checked and tended to while in the chair 45 mins prior because then WHY would the Dr call me saying he is refusing to sit in a chair and he can't release him till he does! Grrrrr! What would you do.... Try to convince him to stay? Or be his ride home on his own AMA? How do you tell your parent no? And yet how do I feel he is in the best care at this negligent hospital!? I'm so torn!"

Wanting to impress English-speakers with your French is not a very good reason — wanting to get to know a French person in their own language is another matter entirely. No matter your reason, once you’ve decided on a language, it’s crucial to commit.

1,"The muscle control you are referring to is known as 'kegel exercises'. This process uses the pelvic muscles, which in turn improves the control of the bladder as well as improving the sensation during sexual intercourse.

Pleasure during intercourse
You can do these exercises during sex as it will increase the pleasure of the act. By doing this, the pelvic muscles will contract stronger which will eventually lead to better and more intense orgasms. In order to do this correctly, you should squeeze and release your pelvic muscles during intercourse to increase your pleasure.
The muscles
In the majority of cases, after giving birth or going through the menopause, the pelvic muscles, one of which is known as the pubococcygeus, can become stretched and loosen. This will ultimately result in a small loss of bladder control during activities such as laughing or coughing.
How to do kegel exercises
You may find it difficult to start doing these because these particular muscles cannot be easily identified due to their remote location, so you may not be sure if you are contracting and releasing properly. The best way to practise is when you go to urinate. In this case you should contract the muscles by stopping the flow of urine and then releasing. They are the kegel exercises and once you have identified them you can do them at any time, however, do not confuse these with buttock clenches."
1,I am no expert on this but if a man does it you will last longer during sex and when a woman does it makes her seem tighter.

I personally have experienced hate while i was at a private christian school because i was gay. The only thing making people believe that your sexual orientation is a sin is beliefs and ignorance."
1,Some would say that being gay is a demon that can be cast out.
0,"Because they pick and choose what Bible verses to believe .. And the Old Testament in Leviticus says that homosexuality is a sin deserving death. 
Of course, it also says not to eat certain things or wear clothing made of multiple materials ... Which they conveniently ignore."
1,B cuz the Bible says in 1st Chorinthians 6:9 that homosexuals will not enter the kingdom of God
1,Your sexual orientation has nothing to do with hell or heaven because both don't exist. You live right and do whatever makes you happy without hurting other. Hell or heaven created by you with the kind of living you do.
1,"If you are referring to one of the three monothestic religions the reason it was frowned on was because homosexuality was often seen in temple prostitution to other gods such as Ishtar. It is the homosexual act that is ""taboo""often translated as an abomination in the bible.
It is also noted that when man and woman join in love they become one flesh.
In Genesis 2:22 Woman was made from man's rib/side. In Jewish Midrash Adam or Adama was both male and female androgenous.
The LORD God fashioned into a woman the rib which He had taken from the man, and brought her to the man. The man said, ""This is now bone of my bones, And flesh of my flesh; She shall be called Woman, Because she was taken out of Man."" For this reason a man shall leave his father and his mother, and be joined to his wife; and they shall become one flesh.

Genesis 2:24
Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: And they shall be one flesh.
Mark 10:8
And they twain shall be one flesh: So then they are no more twain, but one flesh.
Cor 6:16
Or do you not know that the one who joins himself to a prostitute is one body with her? For He says, ""THE TWO SHALL BECOME ONE FLESH.""
Eph 5:28 - 29
So husbands ought also to love their own wives as their own bodies. He who loves his own wife loves himself; for no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, just as Christ also does the church,
Even in tantric sex the union must be between man and woman which is eastern belief."
0,"Opinions seem to communicate Choice. Can you choose who you fall in love with? When did I choose to be heterosexual . . .
That being said, Most holy Scriptures have a problem with Same sex relationships. It was either misunderstood be the original writers, or Simply meant that the union would not produce fresh off-spring to Indoctrinate and keep the religion moving forward.
No Gods are required for men to produce texts to control the masses by fear of an invisible eternal punishment.

0,"Q ""Why do some people think you'll go to hell just for being gay? Like can't you have an opinion over who you want to love??""
Let's start with what you have boiled it down to: ""can't you have an opinion over who you want to love??""
If, say, it's just a handful of you on an Island by yourselves where no rules apply [extremely impractical, of course] then perhaps you cannot only have an opinion over who you want to love, be it your neighbour's wife, daughter or son, [or even all three] or what you want to smoke or snort but you can go ahead and act on that opinion.
However, if you want to organise yourselves into a smoothly functioning society then you will need rules or laws for the wellbeing and future of your society. Even in the most liberal of societies you will have limits beyond which you cannot put your opinions into practice. In the more conservative ones you might be taken to task for just expressing certain opinions, let alone acting upon them.
If a society enacts a certain law it will stipulate what it considers appropriate punishment for any breach of the law. Where a law accepted by a society comes from, or is claimed to come from, an external source [federal, international or ""God""] then that source will most likely have stipulated what it considers appropriate punishment for any breach of the law [be it imprisonment, lashes, stoning or a spell in hell, or any combination thereof]."
0,"I'm a Catholic, but I have to say that I don't believe in a lot of things that the Church teaches.
First, I believe that an individual's relationship with God is between that person and God, and nobody else.  This is why I do not believe in confession.  First of all, God will know what sins I have committed, and he will know if I am repentant.  What reason is there to go and confess your transgressions to another human being?
As far as going to Hell when you die, I believe that only people who are evil and have committed evil deeds while they were alive wind up going to Hell.
Even if you never went to a mass in your entire life, but you are a good person with a kind heart, then you are going to go to Heaven.
Being gay certainly does NOT make you evil.  You are allowed to love who you want to love.  If that happens to be another man or another woman, or both, so be it.
I firmly believe that what determines where you go in the afterlife depends fully on how you treated other living things when you were on Earth. 
If you were malicious and you constantly hurt others and aimed to destroy the happiness of others, then you will reap what you sow."

1,"The muscle control you are referring to is known as 'kegel exercises'. This process uses the pelvic muscles, which in turn improves the control of the bladder as well as improving the sensation during sexual intercourse.

Pleasure during intercourse
You can do these exercises during sex as it will increase the pleasure of the act. By doing this, the pelvic muscles will contract stronger which will eventually lead to better and more intense orgasms. In order to do this correctly, you should squeeze and release your pelvic muscles during intercourse to increase your pleasure.
The muscles
In the majority of cases, after giving birth or going through the menopause, the pelvic muscles, one of which is known as the pubococcygeus, can become stretched and loosen. This will ultimately result in a small loss of bladder control during activities such as laughing or coughing.
How to do kegel exercises
You may find it difficult to start doing these because these particular muscles cannot be easily identified due to their remote location, so you may not be sure if you are contracting and releasing properly. The best way to practise is when you go to urinate. In this case you should contract the muscles by stopping the flow of urine and then releasing. They are the kegel exercises and once you have identified them you can do them at any time, however, do not confuse these with buttock clenches."
1,I am no expert on this but if a man does it you will last longer during sex and when a woman does it makes her seem tighter.
1,"Practicing specific exercises that improve ejaculatory control. Kegel, for example, is one of the best known exercises that help to strengthen the PC muscles in your pelvis region. Once these ""love muscles"" are strengthened, you can stop an approaching ending either by contracting these muscles or simply keeping them relaxed.

health issues such as placenta accreta and preeclampsia as risk factors"
1,"These are the top 7 benefits of Social media Marketing:
1. Increased Brand Awareness
Social media is one of the most cost-efficient digital marketing
methods used to syndicate content and increase your business’
visibility. Implementing a social media strategy will greatly increase
your brand recognition since you will be engaging with a broad audience of consumers.
To get started, create social media profiles for your business and
begin interacting with others. Get employees, business partners, and
sponsors to ""like"" and ""share"" your page. Simply having people interact
with your content will increase brand awareness and begin building your reputation as a business. Each post that is shared will be introduced to a new network of individuals, which can lead them to becoming potential customers, and the more people who know about your business, the better.
By investing only a few hours per week, over 91% of marketers claimed
that their social marketing efforts greatly increased their exposure.
There is no doubt that by simply having a social media page your brand will benefit, and with regular use it can generate a wide
audience for your business.
2. More Inbound Traffic
Without marketing your business on social media, your inbound traffic
is limited to your usual customers. The people familiar with your brand
are likely searching for the same keywords you already rank for.
Without utilizing social media as part of your marketing strategy,
you’ll have much more difficulty reaching anyone outside of your loyal
customer circle.
Every social media profile you add to your marketing mix is a gateway
to your website, and every piece of content you post is another
opportunity to acquire a new customer. Social media is a melting pot of
different types of people with varying backgrounds and behaviors. With
different people come different needs and different ways of thinking.
Syndicating your content on as many platforms as possible allows
these individuals to organically reach your business. For instance,
perhaps someone in an older demographic of consumers will search for
your website using a particular keyword on Facebook, but a millennial
could begin their search by using a different social media platform
entirely, because they search for products totally differently. By
marketing on social media you can effectively open your business to a
wider variety of versatile consumers all over the world.
3. Improved Search Engine Rankings
Although posting on social media might get your business some site
traffic, more effort than that is required to see significant success. Search Engine Optimization
is very important for achieving higher page rankings and obtaining
traffic to your business website. While social media doesn’t directly
increase search engine rankings, Social Media Examiner states that more than 58% of marketers who have been using social media for one year or longer still see improved search engine rankings. Being able to rank in the top positions for your keywords will revolutionize your traffic and continue to generate positive results for your business.
To give yourself the best chance of ranking better through social
media, create high quality content that integrates your targeted
keywords. Content such as blogs, infographics, case studies, business
information, and employee photos will make your business’s social media profile intriguing and credible. Once you begin posting quality content, you’ll begin to build a social media community where followers will ""like"" and ""share"" your content. Most importantly, it gives you more
opportunities to get in front of industry influencers who will write
about your business and provide links back – which will help to directly
increase search engine rankings.
4. Higher Conversion Rates
With increased visibility, your business gains more opportunities for
conversion. Every blog post, image, video, or comment may lead viewers to your company’s website and increase traffic. Social media marketing allows your business to give a positive impression through a
humanization factor. When brands are interactive by sharing content,
commenting, and posting statuses on social media, it personifies a
brand. People prefer to do business with other people, rather than
companies.
Over 51% of marketers claimed that taking the time to develop
relationships with consumers showed positive results in sales. The
better impression you make on a visitor, the more likely they are to
think of your business when the need for your product or services
arises.
Studies have also shown that social media has a 100% higher lead-to-close rate than outbound marketing. When a brand is interactive online, consumers who follow your brand’s accounts often begin to more completely trust the credibility of your business.
5. Better Customer Satisfaction
Social media is a networking and communication platform. Creating a
voice for your company through these platforms is important in
humanizing your company. Customers appreciate knowing that when they post comments on your pages, they will receive a personalized response rather than an automated message. Being able to acknowledge each comment shows that you are attentive of your visitors’ needs and aim to provide the best experience.
Every customer interaction on your business’s social media accounts
is an opportunity to publicly demonstrate your compassion for your
customers. Whether an individual has a question or a complaint, social
media allows you to address the matter using interpersonal dialogue. A
brand devoted to customer satisfaction that takes the time to compose
personal messages will inherently be viewed in a positive light, even if
responding to a customer complaint.
6. Improved Brand Loyalty
One of the main goals of almost all businesses is developing a loyal
customer base. Considering that customer satisfaction and brand loyalty typically go hand in hand, it is important to regularly engage with consumers and begin developing a bond with them. Social media is not just limited to introducing your brand’s products and promotional
campaigns. Customers see these platforms as a service channel where they can communicate directly with the business.
The millennial generation is known for being the most brand loyal
customers of all. Born between the early 1980’s and the early 2000’s,
millennials are the largest generation in US history -– and will soon
completely consume the market. Studies show that this Segment
of customers is 62% more loyal to brands that directly engage with them on social media. Since these technology natives require communication with their brands, businesses must implement social media marketing to get the attention of their most influential consumers.
7. More Brand Authority
Customer satisfaction and brand loyalty both play a part in making
your business more authoritative, but it all comes down to
communication. When consumers see your company posting on social media, especially replying to customers and posting original content, it makes you appear more credible. Regularly interacting with customers
demonstrates that your business cares about customer satisfaction, and is available to answer any questions that they might have. Satisfied
customers are eager to spread the word about a great product or service and they usually turn to social media to express their opinion. Having customers mention your business on social media will advertise your business, and show new visitors your value and brand authority. Once you obtain a few satisfied customers who are vocal about their positive purchase experience, you can let the advertising be done for you by actual customers who enjoyed your product or service."

Good hair care contains simple steps like brushing and combing, shampooing and drying, treating baldness, hair conditioning, dandruff, hair dyes, split ends and hair loss treatment and some other methods. We can start hair care from home. With right care and interest you can bring back its vitality and glossy shine.

• Brush your hair before shampooing to eliminate the tangles.
• Brushing is less damaging than combing but a long brushing can also damage the hair.
• Back combing is also harmful for the hair. It causes knotting which is not easy to untangle.
• Always use a good comb if you feel more comfortable in combing. A good comb can be categorized as a comb which have rounded and soft teeth.
• Nylon brushes with pointed ends also break the hair.
• If you are suffering from the Dandruff-the most common problem, immediately get rid of it by applying good and suitable hair oils.
• Keep your head clean. Don't neglect the hygiene of head.
• Use good shampoos and conditions for healthy looking hairs. Nutritious shampoos are the best choice because hairlessness is caused due to insufficient nutrition."

Additionally, people both deliberately and subliminally influence internal judgements about individuals they see, so hair and other style can actually change the way people see each other.

1,"Michael Jackson's music spanned a number of genres, but the vast majority of his work is pop music, hence his title as the ""King of Pop"".

Michael Jackson is the most successful entertainer of all time, and was a global figure in pop culture for 40 years. He began his career in 1964, forming a band with his brothers called The Jackson 5, and beginning his solo career in 1971.

He is known for his distinct vocal style, complicated dance techniques and his pioneering use of music videos.
Michael Jackson died in 2009 (of propofol intoxication) at the age of 50 in his Los Angeles mansion. His doctor had found him not breathing but with a pulse, and started CPR immediately. Paramedics were called, but Jackson was pronounced dead at the local hospital shortly after.

Since then his doctor has been convicted of involuntary manslaughter and sentenced to four years in prison. The coroner ruled that the doctor had accidentally given Jackson an overdose of propofol and anti-anxiety pills.

Genres of Michael Jackson's music
- Pop

- Rhythm and Blues

- Soul

- Motown

- techno

- new jack swing

- funk

- rock

In particular, one of Michael Jackson's most successful albums, ""Thriller"" explores numerous different genres. The album contains aggressive dance songs and rock tracks such as ""Beat it"". Another hit from the album ""Billie Jean"" has notable funk influences. In contrast the ballads on albums such as ""Human Nature"" were softer and more soulful."

The earliest known inscriptions in the Latin alphabet date from the 6th century BC. It was adapted from the Etruscan alphabet during the 7th century BC.

As was done to the ""Father"" whose name Yhwh was corrupted to Jehovah so was done to the ""Son"" whose name Yeshoo3ah [the 3 indicates that the 'a' vowel is a guttural sound]  has been corrupted to Jesus.
Just like the ""Son"" cannot be blamed for not turning his head if called upon by the corrupted name that he was never called by at any point in his time on earth and which bears no resemblance to the name he was given, similarly the ""Father"" might not respond to those who cannot be bothered to call him by the name they see in their scriptures.
While on the topic of the real name of the ""Son"" it is intriguing to note that in
OT prophecies that are said to apply to ""Jesus"", in Isaiah  for example, he is not
mentioned by name, neither is he referred to by his title Messiah or Anointed,
However, in Psalm 20:6 we read of God saving His Messiah. The verse says, “Now know I that the LORD saveth his anointed; he will hear him from his holy heaven
with the saving strength of his right hand.”
The root of the word Yeshoo3ah has to do with the verb save. The elongated oo vowel in the middle suggests a passive form. Thus Yeshoo3ah means one who was saved. It does not mean one who saved which is Yashaa3ah. So Yeshoo3ah means saved not saviour, This makes it consistent with the prophecy in Psalm 20:6 as quoted above."

1,"Individuals should consult with their physician before adopting any exercise or diet regimen.
To lose weight, some have tried these tips:
1. Be aware of the calories in what you are eating and drinking. Note: Drinks can be a major source of calories, especially sweetened juices. Alcoholic drinks are also high in calories. And beware of those widely advertised soft drinks. Check the calorie count on the label. You might be shocked.
2. Avoid temptation. If chips, chocolates, or cookies are on hand, you will inevitably eat them! Replace them with low-calorie snacks, such as apples, carrots, whole-grain wafers.
3. Have a snack or an appetizer before eating a meal. It will take the edge off your appetite and may induce you to eat less.
4. Don’t eat everything put in front of you. Be selective. Reject what you know will give you too many calories.
5. Slow down. Why hurry? Enjoy your meal by noticing what you are eating—the colors, the flavors, the interaction of foods. Listen to the body’s signals that say, “I’m full. I don’t need any more.”
6. Stop eating before you feel full.
7. Restaurants in some countries are notorious for serving excessive portions. Leave half of your entrée behind, or share the plate with someone else.
8. Desserts are not essential to complete a meal. It is better to finish off with fruit or another low-calorie item.
9. Food manufacturers want you to eat more. Profit is their bottom line. They will try to exploit your weaknesses. Don’t be taken in by their clever advertising and pretty pictures. You can say no!"

case the appropriate tools and equipment needed to rescue people are
not available, the risks and death tolls associated with a natural
disaster grow exponentially. Water, medical facilities, food and
shelter are some of the basic needs that need to be provided after a
man made or natural disaster.One of the ways through which fast
shelter can be set up is through use of disaster
relief tents.
This is the latest innovation that is making it easy for people to
cope with different types of disasters.Ideally, these are lightweight
in nature and as such, they can be easily carried to distant places
without facing much difficulty. They can be folded up easily as well
and set up within the shortest timeline. In order to set up disaster
relief tents, you don't need any special equipment or extra pair of
hands. Another way through which these tents can be of great use is
when they are used to house volunteers. People who are doing
volunteer work to save disaster victims can be housed in these tents
as they carry on with the rescue operations. These tents can also be
used to set up equipment that aids with tracing the weather and other
technologically advanced tool for scoping the area and establishing
whether there are other people trapped or lost in the locality. It
is important to buy tents from a reputed brand."

0,"Q ""Why do some people think you'll go to hell just for being gay? Like can't you have an opinion over who you want to love??""
Let's start with what you have boiled it down to: ""can't you have an opinion over who you want to love??""
If, say, it's just a handful of you on an Island by yourselves where no rules apply [extremely impractical, of course] then perhaps you cannot only have an opinion over who you want to love, be it your neighbour's wife, daughter or son, [or even all three] or what you want to smoke or snort but you can go ahead and act on that opinion.
However, if you want to organise yourselves into a smoothly functioning society then you will need rules or laws for the wellbeing and future of your society. Even in the most liberal of societies you will have limits beyond which you cannot put your opinions into practice. In the more conservative ones you might be taken to task for just expressing certain opinions, let alone acting upon them.
If a society enacts a certain law it will stipulate what it considers appropriate punishment for any breach of the law. Where a law accepted by a society comes from, or is claimed to come from, an external source [federal, international or ""God""] then that source will most likely have stipulated what it considers appropriate punishment for any breach of the law [be it imprisonment, lashes, stoning or a spell in hell, or any combination thereof]."
0,"I'm a Catholic, but I have to say that I don't believe in a lot of things that the Church teaches.
First, I believe that an individual's relationship with God is between that person and God, and nobody else.  This is why I do not believe in confession.  First of all, God will know what sins I have committed, and he will know if I am repentant.  What reason is there to go and confess your transgressions to another human being?
As far as going to Hell when you die, I believe that only people who are evil and have committed evil deeds while they were alive wind up going to Hell.
Even if you never went to a mass in your entire life, but you are a good person with a kind heart, then you are going to go to Heaven.
Being gay certainly does NOT make you evil.  You are allowed to love who you want to love.  If that happens to be another man or another woman, or both, so be it.
I firmly believe that what determines where you go in the afterlife depends fully on how you treated other living things when you were on Earth. 
If you were malicious and you constantly hurt others and aimed to destroy the happiness of others, then you will reap what you sow."

1,"Jesus"" is an Anglicized form of the Greek name Yesous found in the New Testament. Yesous represents the Hebrew Bible name Yeshua, which occurs as ""Jeshua"" in English Bibles (Ezra 2:2; Neh 7:7).
In Medieval English the ""J"" was pronounced as a ""Y."" ""Yehoshua""Yeshua, in turn, is a shortened form of the name Yehoshua (""Joshua"" in English Bibles).
Moses' right-hand man, Joshua, has three names in the Bible. Originally, it was Hoshea, but Moses changed it to Yehoshua (Num 13:16). During the Babylonian Exile, it was shorted to Yeshua (Neh 8:17

1,"(Je?sus) [Lat. Form of the Gr. I?e?sous?, which corresponds to the Heb. Ye?shu?a? or Yehoh?shu?a?"
1,"Ancient Latin alphabet
The earliest known inscriptions in the Latin alphabet date from the 6th century BC. It was adapted from the Etruscan alphabet during the 7th century BC. The letters Y and Z were taken from the Greek alphabet to write Greek loan words. Other letters were added from time to time as the Latin alphabet was adapted for other languages."
1,"Q ""If there were only three original languages; Hebrew, Latin, and Greek, where does the name Jesus come from? None of these languages had a J in their alphabet.""
As was done to the ""Father"" whose name Yhwh was corrupted to Jehovah so was done to the ""Son"" whose name Yeshoo3ah [the 3 indicates that the 'a' vowel is a guttural sound]  has been corrupted to Jesus.
Just like the ""Son"" cannot be blamed for not turning his head if called upon by the corrupted name that he was never called by at any point in his time on earth and which bears no resemblance to the name he was given, similarly the ""Father"" might not respond to those who cannot be bothered to call him by the name they see in their scriptures.
While on the topic of the real name of the ""Son"" it is intriguing to note that in
OT prophecies that are said to apply to ""Jesus"", in Isaiah  for example, he is not
mentioned by name, neither is he referred to by his title Messiah or Anointed,
However, in Psalm 20:6 we read of God saving His Messiah. The verse says, “Now know I that the LORD saveth his anointed; he will hear him from his holy heaven
with the saving strength of his right hand.”
The root of the word Yeshoo3ah has to do with the verb save. The elongated oo vowel in the middle suggests a passive form. Thus Yeshoo3ah means one who was saved. It does not mean one who saved which is Yashaa3ah. So Yeshoo3ah means saved not saviour, This makes it consistent with the prophecy in Psalm 20:6 as quoted above."

• Nursing
• Zoology
• Biochemistry
• Biotechnology
• Dentistry
• Pharmacy
• Occupational therapy

Having taken Plus Two Science, it could also be possible to change towards a completely non-science related course at degree level. People who have taken Plus Two Science have moved on to take degrees in a number of diverse areas that are not strictly related to the content of the science course that they had previously studied. Courses that Plus Two Science students have gone on to studies include areas such as commerce, banking, management, languages, media and teaching.

Taking a strong academic course like Plus Two science should mean that your career options remain fairly open after you have completed the course. Although medicine and engineering are the two most obvious, common and popular career options, they are by no means the only career routes that are available to you. You should not feel pressurized into pursuing medicine or engineering if it is not a career you will enjoy. You are still in a strong position to pursue whatever career option appeals to you - you have time on your side in your career ahead of you.

Most schools and colleges have specialist career advisers who can help guide you towards a career option that interests you. Failing that, there are plenty of books that can provide you with useful tips.

1,"Hello,
Thanks for Asking..!!
Deciding career after 12th is really hard. Many students get confused which field is better & have good career opportunities, job securities.
But it should be decided very carefully. Because the future depends on this decision.
Well,  the students who take Science subject, their main target is to become Engineer or Doctor.
But Except Engineering & Doctor, there are many other professions available.
B.Sc. + M.Sc. Will also help you to get a successful career.

The Best option which comes in my mind after Engineering & Medical is Research career.

If Science is the subject of your interest & you want to get good job opportunities & Reputed work, then go for Research field.

For this you have to prepare for CSIR NET Exam. Which is the national eligibility test, conducted for science students who are  willing to pursue your career further as a Junior Research Fellow or an Assistant Professor.

You can also go for Management Courses like - BBA (Bachelor of Business Administration), BHM (Bachelor of Hotel Management), BMS (Bachelor of Management Studies) etc.

As we all know that management courses are in very demand. So you can think about it.

B.C.A. - Bachelor of Computer Applications is also a degree course of 3 year duration in which you have to learn about Computers, software and applications, programming languages etc.

After completing BCA/ MCA , you can get a job in private as well as Government sectors of Software developer, Computer Engineer etc.

B.Arch. - Bachelor of Architecture

It is a 5 year course in which you read about lanning and construction of homes, buildings, commercial structures, public utility structures etc.

You can get a job of Consultant, Planning & Design professional, Chief Architect etc.

Other career options are -

B.Pharmacy. , B.B.A., Navy courses , Diploma courses (Biotechnology, Jewellery Designing, Interior Designing, Event Management etc)
I hope it will help you.

There seems to be a lot of hype surrounding Tinder, and no doubt Tinder Desktop will only increase the buzz. To me, Tinder is perhaps the most soulless of dating apps, but it doesn't pretend to be much else, so I've got to give it some credit.
Users are presented with very little information about their suitors, usually just a name picture, and age before they say yay or nay. I've never had the joy of using Tinder myself, but it seems fairly obvious that Tinder is unlikely to help you find a meaningful relationship.
Tinder Desktop offers no variation from the original app. But, if you want easy access to a list of possible hook-ups, which you can browse when you should be hard at work, or if you think you’re in need of another social media platform that you can endlessly refresh, then maybe Tinder Desktop is for you.
However, using Tinder Desktop isn't without its risks. You should be careful about what information you divulge to your new 'friends', and always be extra cautious when meeting strangers."
1,"Tinder Desktop is a version of the Tinder app which runs on PC's operated by Windows.
In order to have it fully functioning you must go through a few simple steps, namely:
1 - You need to first download Andy Android emulator software to your computer. It is available for free on the official website (http://www.andyroid.net/). 
It’s trusted software and used by millions of users, therefore pretty safe.
2 - Then you need to click on the installer file you downloaded and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation process.
3 - Once the software starts running, it will ask you a few simple questions which will complete the setup and you will end up seeing an Android tablet like user interface.
4 -You will then see the Google Play store app within Andy (just like on any Android device). Launch that app.
5 - Using the Google Play search tool, search for ""Tinder app"".
6 - Finally click on the “Install” option to begin the automatic installation of this app on your computer.

Is it just simple curiosity that makes you want to do this? If you're interested in other people's lives, you should maybe start reading autobiographies,, which are written by people who want to share the details of their lives with complete strangers.
Sexual gratification?
Do you want to look for pictures  that will turn you on? How did it come to this? If this is you motivation, you need to learn something about consent and objectification. The people in those photos have not consented to you objectification of them.

Facebook is a social networking service and website launched in February 2004, operated and privately owned by Facebook, Inc. As of January 2011, Facebook has more than 600 million active users. Users may create a personal profile, add other users as friends, and exchange messages, including automatic notifications when they update their profile. Facebook users must register before using the site. Additionally, users may join common-interest user groups, organized by workplace, school or college, or other characteristics. The name of the service stems from the colloquial name for the book given to students at the start of the academic year by university administrations in the United States to help students get to know each other better. Facebook allows any users who declare themselves to be at least 13 years old to become registered users of the website.

Facebook was founded by Mark Zuckerberg with his college roommates and fellow computer science students Eduardo Saverin, Dustin Moskovitz and Chris Hughes. The website's membership was initially limited by the founders to Harvard students, but was expanded to other colleges in the Boston area, the Ivy League, and Stanford University. It gradually added support for students at various other universities before opening to high school students, and, finally, to anyone aged 13 and over, but based on ConsumersReports.org on May 2011, there are 7.5 million children under 13 with accounts, violating the site's terms. The story of Facebook has recently been made into a movie entitled ‘The Social Network’ which tells the story of Facebook’s invention and the legal battles that followed."

Ecommerce helps in developing new payment mechanisms system like transfer wire etc which was not present in the past. Online services and marketing towards the people with putting much cost, reduced the cost of labor. Amazon.com is the big example. One can get the customized product just by sitting in his /her place.

1,"Broad Reach: Ecommerce website reaches the local, national and international audience through a single website. Nowadays a customer can place or receive his/her order from any part of the country.
Single Platform: Customer can find all their daily use product on a single platform. Like Mobile, Kitchen item, Bathroom accessories, gifts toys, etc. All products are easily available on desktop, mobile, tablet or application. An eCommerce website provides all the products to the customers.
Easy Payment Option: eCommerce website offers different payment option to the customers like Cash On Delivery, Credit Card, Debit Card, Bank Transfer, etc. ECommerce must understand customer needs and offer them different payment gateway for hassle free transaction experience.
Customer Protection: eCommerce website must provide customer data protection facility. Nowadays customer shares their confidential information such as credit card, username, password in shopping website. That is why it is important for an eCommerce website to install SSL Certificate on their server. SSL Certificate creates a secure bridge between user browser and the server and protects all the confidential information from hackers and eavesdropping attacks.
Customer Review: eCommerce website must collect and display customer review to other visitors. This will help the new customer to take an appropriate decision during the purchasing process."
1,"An operating system, or OS, is a software program that enables the computer hardware to communicate and operate with the computer software. The most well-known operating systems are Windows, Mac OS and Linux, all of which have different versions. Although Windows is a PC-based OS, it can be run on a Mac computer with the help of a programme called Parallels, for example. Generally speaking, here is a brief summary of pros and cons of each major operating system:

Windows:
- Can be expensive, especially compared to Linux, which is in most cases free.
- Easy to use, especially for new computer users, and plenty of help resources are available online.
- Although Microsoft Windows has made great improvements in reliability with recent versions, it still lags behind its competitors.
- It has a large library of available software, games and utilities, although many are expensive.
- Hardware manufacturers all make drivers and support for Windows OS.
- Openness to virus attacks is a major disadvantage.

Linux:
- It is an open source OS, which in most cases is free.
- Inexperienced computer users may find it more difficult to get to grips with Linux.
- It is very reliable and rarely freezes.
- Fewer computer programs, games and utilities are available for Linux.
- Many programs are free or open source, even very complex ones.
- There are still some manufacturers that do not offer hardware support for Linux OS, although there are fewer every year.
- The open source nature of Linux allows more advanced users to customise the code as they wish.
- Fewer people use Linux, therefore it is more difficult to find someone fully familiar with it, although there are vast resources online.

Mac OS:
- MAC computers are more expensive generally than PCs.
- MAC is a much more secure OS, and is far less open to viruses and malware.
- Stability is a major advantage - it very rarely crashes, loses data or freezes.
- Fewer computer programs and games are available for MACs.
- As most computer components of MACs are made by Apple, there are not many driver issues, unlike with PCs, which are made by many different manufacturers
MAC OS is not as customisable as Windows or Linux."
1,"Advantages:
1.easy to use
2.user friendly
3.intermediate between all hardwares and softwares of the system
4.no need to know any technical languages
5.Its the platform of all programs

disadvantages:

1.if any problems affected in OS, you may lose all the contents which have been stored already
2.unwanted user can use your own system"
1,"Well every personal computer or business computer, has an operating system. Such as Windows Vista, Windows XP, Windows 2000, Mac OS tiger, Mac OS leopard, Linux. Etc.

This is where you come to choose, you should check what software or hardware that is available to be used on the specific OS. Not all software works on ever OS!!! So you might have to do some research on what is the most compatible for you. Because this can save you a lot of money!

Hopefully this was helpful!
Any other questions, msg me!
Andrew."
1,"Windows have a very high compatability with games, and basically everything is on windows!
MAC's are expensive and non customisable, for example you can't upgrade the componants inside very easily and a lot of game are not compatible!! Only good thing really is the custom voices in the terminal and virus protection."

1,"The advantages of the operating system are, compatibility, speed, user interface, piracy. The main disadvantages are virus, malware, and resource hog."
11,"There are no disadvantages to an operating system, being that without an operating system, a computer would not be able to function, at least where it would be any more than a series of static pictures.

Think of the operating system as you would think of the traffic lights in a major city, say, New York, for example.  Just as the traffic lights regulate the traffic in the city, the operating system regulates the traffic in the computer.  And not only that, it also serves as the liaison between the programs you may have installed and the computer.  Think of it somewhat like an attendant at an airport terminal.  You can see the planes out on the tarmac, you can see flights landing and leaving, however, how would you know which plane is which, if you do not have someone to guide you.  And that is the attendant, or one could say the liaison that acts as a go between the planes and the passengers.  Basically, an operating systems nothing more than a liaison between the hardware and the software, and of course much, much more.  Look up Operating Systems on the Internet, there's a wealth of knowledge to be had for free.  What I have mentioned is simply scratching the surface."

single at least once a day ever since it was released."
1,Hi! It will have to be Despacito by Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee! The song is popular all over the world and most youngsters know the lyrics by heart even if it’s all in Spanish. I also enjoy the remixed version; it features Justin Bieber and it holds some English bits that make it even better!

He had a heart attack that he wouldn't have survived if there wasn't a paramedic standing next to him at the time. Both my grandfathers died from heart disease, and they both smoked. My sister-in-law's brother refused to quit. He has had several heart attacks and a stroke. He looks like a walking skeleton. He has tried to quit, and has several times, but it never seems to stick. For some the addiction is too hard to kick."

1,"Hello there. This is the question I asked myself a few years
ago after the death of an uncle who suffered from a heart disease. The decision
was not hard to take at all as it was either shortening my days on Earth or
living healthily without smoking. Right now, it has been five years since I
stopped inhaling tobacco, and I do not regret the decision at all."
1,"Yes..!
smoking can increase the risk of heart disease.
It affects the vessels that supply blood to your heart and other parts of your body. It also reduces the amount of oxygen in your blood and damages blood vessel walls severely.
Smokers not only have more heart attacks, strokes, and angina than non-smokers but also at a much younger age.
Smoking not only affects the heart it also affects your health and leads to cancer & other health problems. So, for a healthy body, you should stop smoking."

How many days a week does a patient go to dialysis?
Have you ever known anyone to regain their kidney function?

1,"I don't think any app like that exists. Ofcourse, there's websites for job listings, but not an app.
Indeed and SimplyHired are both websites that provide job openings for job seekers.
SimplyHired allows you to find jobs near your area by entering your city and state that you live in as well as the job title that you're looking for. It also has a count at the top saying ""x new jobs since your last visit"", where ""x"" is a number.
Indeed is pretty much a replica for SimplyHired, just re-formatted. So you can use either website and you'll get pretty relevant job search results.
Keep in mind, though, it's not so easy that all you have to do is apply online and you get the job. No, most employers will ask to schedule an appointment for an interview and ask that you bring a resume and cover letter.
I wish you the best of luck in your job hunt!"

One app I'd recommend downloading no matter where you are is LinkedIn Jobs.
LinkedIn is the largest social network for ""professionals and recruiters"", so it makes sense to use their app if you're looking for a job. you can find it here:
https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/linkedin-job-search/id886051313?mt=8
One of the best features is the ""Apply in App"" option. If you have a LinkedIn profile that offers enough details about you to potential employers, then applying for jobs can be as simple as tapping a button, rather than filling out complicated forms and uploading documents.
Other apps that will help you find a job (based on your location)
USA. Indeed is the biggest job database in the States, and is again available on both Android and iPhone. The great thing about Indeed is the ability to be able to apply for jobs straight from your phone. It's really intuitive and easy to use, and is handy if you're on the run but still want to be productive.
UK. Monster is available for Android and iPhone, and has one of the largest selection of job adverts in the country. You can also upload your CV through the website and employers have the opportunity to contact you directly if they like the look of your skillset.
If you're in a different country, I apologise! But if you search through your phone's app store I'm sure you'll have an equivalent for your country. If all else fails, head to your local job centre and they should be able to point you in the direction of the best resources."

According to reviews you will see results after two weeks or so, but after several months of consistent use, you should have an even brighter skin tone.
We have not tested this ourselves however, we would recommend using natural remedies and concentrate on accepting yourself for who you are, including your skin colour.  We all have something about ourselves that we could change if we had the option.  For many people, being able to make these changes, say having plastic surgery or losing a lot of eight doesn't solve the underlying issues of low self esteem that will still need to be dealt with.

1,"If you have a dark appearance and have the desire to make your skin fairer, there are a variety of things you can explore. Dark skin is sometimes a sign of too much melanin in the skin - but if you wish to make your skin tone lighter, you can blend together a mixture of rosewater and sandalwood. This will cool your skin thanks to its relieving properties, leaving it feeling refreshed.
You will be left with a lighter glow due to the fresh properties that sandalwood contains. Other alternatives in the pursuit of lighter skin include making paste of rose water and almonds. You should apply this in a delicate manner to the face on a nightly basis and onto the neck area to encourage a lighter appearance.
It is also true that vegetables have the ability to encourage lighter skin. You can use things like cucumbers and the skins of grapes that can be easily applied to the eyes or neck area as well as tomatoes, which you can gently rub on your face as some are acidic and will remove the dead skills to help you exfoliate. You can even use potatoes - these should be soaked in water for at least ten minutes before gently scrubbing the face.
Almond paste and ground almonds will be able to do similar jobs to the vegetable preparation, and you can also add in a teaspoon of milk and some lime juice to create a thin gloopy paste that you should gently massage into the skin.
You can also drink plenty of grape juice as well as coconut water, which is all the rage as it very healthy and maintains the skin's light appearance and complexion.
In terms of ""becoming fair"" you may be talking about your skin or your hair. Changing your skin colour is becoming more and more common; however it can lead to permanent damage and is often quite dangerous. You must seek professional and regulated products if this is something you decide to go through with. Changing your hair colour is obviously far easier and much safer, but also carries some risk if not done properly.
Changing your skin colour
If this is something you decide to go through with then you must research the best method for you. This could be a home remedy or by using bleaching creams that have a chemical called hydroquinone added to them. These are available in the pharmacy and they work by decreasing melanin production. Melanin is the pigment in your skin which determines the colour of your skin.  However these creams will not have the desired effect in 2 days, but it will take a week to 10 days to start to work.
Lightening your hair
Depending on what your original hair colour is, becoming fair could take 15 minutes or several weeks to get to the shade you desire. If you visit a hairdresser and ask them to go from dark brown or black hair to fair they may advise you to take this in a few steps as the chemicals used to bleach your hair can be very damaging. Generally hairdressers use peroxide to bleach hair, which is a very harsh chemical and can often cause allergic reactions, so always have this done by a professional.
The colour of a person's skin is not primarily due to outside factors although it can be partially influenced by them. A person's skin is a certain colour due to melanin, which is also known as pigment. It is a substance that affects the colour of a person's skin. Melanin absorbs or disperses ultra-violet light. Some theorists believe there is a correlation between dark skin and a substance called folate that is found in all people. In various studies it has been seen that ultra-violet light has a detrimental effect on folate levels. One test showed that when the substance was placed under a source of ultra-violet light the folate levels were reduced by half in just an hour. Folate is a member of the vitamin B family. This vitamin is used in the growth of the body. It is theorised that people with black skin have a high melanin count, which protects the folate in the body from being damaged by ultra-violet light.
     On the other hand some studies have been carried out showing the effect of ultra-violet light on the growth of vitamin D. It has been shown that UV rays promote the growth of vitamin D. A lot of people who have white skin are shown to have lived in the top of the northern hemisphere where UV light is weaker and therefore they produce less vitamin D. Due to this, it is thought that people developed less melanin in these areas so that their bodies would allow more of the UV rays in to grow the vitamin D. When we understand why are skin is a certain colour we can understand that it is not something that can be drastically changed in an easy way but has developed over countless generations to be the way it is now."

Also, many celebrities are among those affected, such as Cameron Diaz, Victoria Beckham and the late Richard Burton, so this only goes to show that acne doesn't have to be a barrier to being considered very attractive.
Make-up can make a tremendous difference to the appearance of the cysts, scars and pitted effect that can be caused by the more severe types of acne, as these photographs of the lovely Ms Diaz show.
There are a number of companies which make specialist camouflage make-up, which can hide a whole range of facial disfigurements such as birthmarks and port wine stains, as well as acne scars.
These products usually differ from mainstream foundations, in that they are designed to stay on a lot longer, and are thicker and more dense than conventional products.
Of course, for mild to moderate acne, non-specialist make-up, well-applied, may be all that is required to transform your appearance, as this video tutorial shows:
However, for more heavy-duty, longer-lasting effects, some of the best-known manufacturers of specialist make-up are as follows:
Covermark
Dermablend
Dermacolor
Keromask
Veil
Click on any of the links above to be taken to the individual companies' websites, so that you can see further details and examples of the types of skin condition that these products can help to camouflage.
Also, to help gain confidence, it would probably be a good idea to watch some of the many videos available online, which show bare-faced acne sufferers applying their make-up.
The results are amazing, and no-one need ever know that you have acne scars or pitting of the skin at all!"

Do this twice a week, and within a couple of months, you should see a real improvement. It takes a bit of time, but stick with it. You won't be sorry."

Another reason that people call Las Vegas 'Sin City' is because there are illegal activities that take place there such as prostitution, drug rings, and underage drinking and gambling. All of these activities are considered to be sins to many people.

1,"Individuals should consult with their physician before adopting any exercise or diet regimen.
To lose weight, some have tried these tips:
1. Be aware of the calories in what you are eating and drinking. Note: Drinks can be a major source of calories, especially sweetened juices. Alcoholic drinks are also high in calories. And beware of those widely advertised soft drinks. Check the calorie count on the label. You might be shocked.
2. Avoid temptation. If chips, chocolates, or cookies are on hand, you will inevitably eat them! Replace them with low-calorie snacks, such as apples, carrots, whole-grain wafers.
3. Have a snack or an appetizer before eating a meal. It will take the edge off your appetite and may induce you to eat less.
4. Don’t eat everything put in front of you. Be selective. Reject what you know will give you too many calories.
5. Slow down. Why hurry? Enjoy your meal by noticing what you are eating—the colors, the flavors, the interaction of foods. Listen to the body’s signals that say, “I’m full. I don’t need any more.”
6. Stop eating before you feel full.
7. Restaurants in some countries are notorious for serving excessive portions. Leave half of your entrée behind, or share the plate with someone else.
8. Desserts are not essential to complete a meal. It is better to finish off with fruit or another low-calorie item.
9. Food manufacturers want you to eat more. Profit is their bottom line. They will try to exploit your weaknesses. Don’t be taken in by their clever advertising and pretty pictures. You can say no!"

India has many opportunities for engineers - however, it may not offer as many factories and plants as countries like China or the USA. The global economy is weak at the moment, and lucrative jobs for skilled workers are harder to come by. Nonetheless, there will always be some demand for manufacturing engineers. To gauge the amount of jobs available in India, check job boards or look at job postings at big corporations in the country. Knowing who's hiring and what they're paying can be extremely useful information as you plan your career path."

1,"All of the body's extremities are susceptible to dry skin, so the fact that it is the skin on your penis that is dry may not be relevant. However, if it is very dry and cracked, then the initial advice must be to consult with your physician. There is no need for embarrassment, as any good doctor will have a lot of experience with such issues. 
I often have dry skin myself, especially around the eyes. I use cucumber cream daily, which keeps this in check, although petroleum jelly enhanced with aloe vera is also very useful. When I shower, I use a gel made by Imperial Leather, made with cotton extract and oat milk.
Showering may be part of the problem - too long in the shower or bath can be bad for the skin, as can swimming in chlorinated water. You may also be cleaning yourself with a soap which is causing an allergic reaction.
Dry skin can also be caused by a lack of vitamins, especially vitamin A. Make sure you get a good supply of vitamin A by eating carrots, eggs, peas, apricots, spinach, pumpkin, oranges, liver or through a multivitamin fruit drink.
You do not specify whether you are sexually active, but if you believe you have contracted this condition through sexual intercourse, then you should visit a sexual health clinic to get tested, and tell the other person involved, as they may need to get checked out as well.
Here's a few more tips on looking after your skin, courtesy of YouTube:"
1,"The penis is made of delicate and sensitive skin. The natural oils which the body produces in this area can be easily knocked out of whack causing all sorts of skin ailments. The best way to tackle the issue is to first address the cause.
Soaps and shower gels can dry out or irritate the skin, particularly in the sensitive areas, so perhaps you could try washing the penis with warm water only, or finding a soap designed for sensitive skin. Hot water can also affect the natural balance, washing away the natural oils, and causing the area to become dry and cracked. Try to use only lukewarm water on this area.
Natural coconut oil is a great solution for skin irritations, and can be used on the area as and when you need it. Not only that, but it's great for the body, as it does not contain any chemicals or additives, You can buy natural coconut oil from most supermarkets and health stores, for less the £10.
If the problem persists, you should also visit a doctor to check that there is no underlying issue, as dry or cracked skin on the genitals can be a symptom of a yeast infection or other conditions.

There are three major groups covered by Search Engine Land’s Periodic Table Of SEO Success Factors:
On-the-page SEO
Off-the-page SEO
Violations
Within each group are subgroups, as each chapter of this SEO guide will explain. These subgroups contain one or more individual SEO factors with a specific weight or importance.
Violations, while a group unto themselves, are displayed under the group and subgroup to which they’re associated.
Those two-letter acronyms you see on the chart above? That’s our play on the periodic table of elements and the letter representations, or symbol, of each element. You may have had to remember that the symbol for gold was Au or that iron was Fe.
In the Periodic Table of SEO, we’ve tried to make it slightly more intuitive. The first letter of each “SEO element” comes from the subgroup that it’s in, and the second letter stands for the individual factor.
SEO factors work in combination
No single SEO factor will guarantee search engine rankings. Having a great HTML title won’t help if a page has low-quality content. Having many links won’t help if they are all low in quality. Having several positive factors can increase the odds of success, while the presence of negative factors can worsen those odds.
On-the-page success factors
On-the-page search ranking factors are those that are almost entirely within the publisher’s own control. What type of content do you publish? Are you providing important HTML clues that help search engines (and users) determine relevancy? How does your site architecture help or hinder search engines?
on page SEO tools for free, https://www.prepostseo.com.
Off-the-page success factors
Off-the-page ranking factors are those that publishers do not directly control. Search engines use these because they learned early on that relying on publisher-controlled signals alone didn’t always yield the best results. For instance, some publishers may try to make themselves seem more relevant than they are in reality.
With billions of web pages to sort through, looking only at “on-the-page” clues isn’t enough. More signals are needed to return the best pages for any particular search.
SEO violations & ranking penalties
Make no mistake — search engines want people to perform SEO because it can help improve their search results. Search engines provide help in the form of guidelines, blog posts, and videos to encourage specific SEO techniques.
However, there are some techniques that search engines deem “spam” or “black hat,” which could result in your pages receiving a ranking penalty, or worse, being banned from the search engines entirely.
Violations are general tactics meant to deceive or manipulate a search engine’s understanding of a site’s true relevancy and authority.
A weighting of search ranking factors
All the factors we show are weighted on a scale of 1 to 3, as shown in the top right corner of each factor, as well as reflected in the hue of that factor. A weighting of 3 is most important and is something you should pay special attention to because it has a bigger impact than other factors.
That doesn’t mean that factors weighted 2 or 1 aren’t important; they are. It’s just that they are of less importance, relatively speaking, in terms of the other factors on the chart. Violations are also weighted, but in negative numbers, with -3 being the worst and potentially most harmful to your SEO success.
The weighting is based on a combination of what search engines have said, surveys of the SEO community and our own expertise and experience in watching the space over time. We don’t expect them to be perfect. Not everyone will agree. Your mileage may vary. But we’re confident it is a useful general guide."

1,"Anonymous........What You Can Do
1.    Focus on your strengths
While  its good to be aware of your flaws, you also have much to offer.  Recognizing your assets will give you the confidence you need to break free from a negative self-image and/or negativity from others and overcome loneliness.  Ask yourself what are my strengths?  Think of some talents or positive qualities that you possess.
2.    Don't limit yourself to people of your own age. 
You may find that the warmest and sincere friendships are between people with considerable age differences.  Remember, too that conversation is an interchange, not a monologue.  People appreciate good listeners.  So if you tend to be shy, remember - you don't have to carry the whole conversation.

Will you not acquire wisdom, use your thinking ability, gain social skills, use common sense and sound judgement.  It's a big world out there the more you learn about the world around you,  the better equipped you will be to know who you are and what you want.
Do not allow anyone to rob you of the value of a good education.  Especially since no one can give you an education - you have to earn your education.  And to do that you must gain the courage you will need to talk to others, (teachers), ask questions and seek answers.

You say you lost your close friends.  But dropping you like a hot rock is not the way close friends act.  Your ""close friends"" were just a group of people that hang together and with you as long as you don't aggravate any of them.

1,"Is it OK to drink cranberry juice, orange juice, etc. While undergoing BCG treatment for bladder cancer?"
1,"While on BCG treatment my husband started to drink black currant juice. I ordered frozen black currants. I filled our Vita-Mix blender a half a way with frozen black currants, one peeled lemon, honey and  little bit of sugar. It makes an amazing cancer fighter drink. He drinks one glass daily.  No signs of cancer has been seen this far.
My father had also a bladder cancer, and this is what he did. It has been 15years since his cancer and he is consider fully healed.

My husband used to drink large quantities of orange juice before his cancer diagnosis.
So he still drinks it, but not that much.  Of cause he used to smoke, too. He is not smoking any more. According his urologist green tea is also an excellent choice."
1,"Bladder cancer pertains to any of the various types of malignant growths of the urinary bladder. The bladder is a muscular hollow organ which stores urine in the pelvic region.
Urinary bladder is a disease which manifests by the growth of abnormal cells which multiply without control, in the bladder. Tobacco abuse, exposure to carcinogenic (cancer-causing) compounds like benzidine is responsible for bladder cancers to a vast extent in both the sexes.

The cure for urinary bladder cancer is dependent upon how deep the tumour makes an intrusion into the bladder wall. Tumours which have not yet entered the hollow muscular wall are superficial tumours that can be taken rid off by using an electrocautery device attached to a cystoscope. Immunotherapy in the form of BCG instillation can be used to prevent the superficial tumours from occurring again. Tumours that attack and infiltrate into the bladder have to be operated through ""radical surgery."" In this a significant part or the entire bladder is removed, through a process known as cystectomy. In some cases, qualified surgeons can create a substitute bladder or a neobladder from a part of intestinal tissue."
1,"Beside Strarwin's very good answer. Their are natural subtances that will aid in the body fighting the cancer as well. You must include a lot of anti-oxidants into the diet. This means orange,cranberry,grape,raspberry(juice or fruit). Look up something on foods and substance with a large amount of anti-oxidants.
Anti-oxidants is what the cells in our body use to fight cancer causing cells. It makes a big difference in how fast cancer grows the body. It also aids in keeping cancer from reoccuring in treated cases. It also leaves cancer in remission for years even if it is considered terminal. Anti-oxidants helps the body keep cancer cell in check."
1,"It is important to think carefully about the best treatment option to be administered. Nevertheless, you will be able to weigh the benefits of different treatment options against the possible side effects and risks.(1)
Some of the treatment options for bladder cancer include:
Surgery
Chemotherapy
Radiation therapy
Immunotherapy
Intravesical therapy
Targeted therapy
Precision medicine
It is also important to have specialized doctors in your team cancer care team before the commencement of any treatment, and these specialists may include are:
Radiation oncologists: Doctors who treat cancer with radiation therapy
Urologists: On the other hand, urologists are doctors that specialize who treat diseases of the urinary system and male reproductive system
Medical oncologists: Lastly, they are doctors who treat cancer with medicines which include chemotherapy and immunotherapy
You might also consider having other specialists alongside your doctors during treatment. These may also include a team of nurse practitioners (NPs), psychologists, physician assistants (Pas), rehabilitation specialists, social workers, nurses, nutrition specialists and other health professionals.

25 reasons why the Samsung Galaxy Note 8 could be considered better than the Apple iPhone X. This is part one of a two part #phonebuffstyle video series.

1,"Both iPhone X and Galaxy Note 8 are good phones, but you need to first compare their specifications to identify the best one.
iPhone X
This iOS phone has 5.8 inch display with scratch-resistant glass and oleophobic coating, 3 GB RAM, 64 GB internal memory and 256 GB expandable memory, dual rear camera of 12MP + 12MP with quad-LED dual-tone flash, panorama and HDR facilities, and 7 MP selfie camera with HDR facility, 2716 mAh battery, etc.

The price of iPhone X is Rs. 88,800 and the Samsung Galaxy Note 8 price is Rs. 55,900. You can choose either of them, but in case you need financing you can rely on no cost EMI."
1,Definitely the Iphone X. It is easier to use and more people know how to use iphones.
1,"Oxycodone is a drug that is widely available on the black market and the price of it varies. On average, it is thought that the cost of 5mg of oxycodone is between $10 and $25, depending on where it is sourced.

• What is oxycodone?

It is a drug that is used as a medication for the relief of moderate to severe pain. The drug is also used for recreational purposes and is said to be as addictive as heroin. The threat of potential overdose of the drug is high and the drug is highly popular amongst teenagers.

• What does it treat?

The drug is used to relieve moderate pain, and in higher doses can also relieve chronic pain. The quality of life for people suffering from pain is said to be increased by using the drug, and it is also used as an alternative to morphine for sufferers of cancer. There have been no trials to show whether the drug is as effective as morphine in the relief of cancer pain.

• Side effects of oxycodone

There are a number of side effects associated with the use of oxycodone. These include memory loss, fatigue and constipation. Other patients report symptoms of anxiety after using the drug, and other effects include loss of appetite and diarrhea. On rare occasions, the drug can cause impotence and an enlarged prostate gland.

• Effects of high doses of oxycodone

If the drug is taken in high doses, it can cause shortness of breath, constriction of the pupils, respiratory arrest and even death.

People should only take oxycodone if a doctor prescribes it, and the correct dosage should be adhered to."
1,"Given the price for an 80mg Oxycontin usually ranges between $30-$40/pill after it goes through enough people in the black market; at the high price end of the spectrum, more often than not Oxycodone will average 2mg for every $1 spent. Given those average street statistics, a 5mg Oxycodone should cost about $2.00- $2.50. -Medical Mike-"

  DUH!!!"
1,Fashion influences people in both good and bad ways for example fashion makes people feel good about them it also makes them feel as if they are with the trend. Fashion can also make bigger people feel good about themselves and the clothes they wear it makes them feel good about their size and shape ! But fashion also makes people want to become thinner and be able to fit intoo the clothes that celebrities would like the basic 'size zero clothes '   and most people end up becoming ill as they are trying to make themselves look good and be like these famous celebrities and models.
1,"It affects people in many different ways
e.g.

you can get picked on or teased about your clothes.

Some times your clothes affect how you feel

or

how you act."
1,"In the trend is sooo lame people are made fun of if the don't wear the latest clothes or can't afford the dear stuff but why ? I mena we are all born different why do we all have to look the same why should somebody be picked on if they don't have the right clothes does it really matter soon fashion and trends will dictate or lives is that what people want :|?
 "
1,"As long as we live in a society, fashion will matter to people. We are conditioned from childhood to ‘Dress to Impress’ Fashion has an impact on our personality first and subsequently our lives. Yes, fashion influences on all individual lifestyles. From the way, we dress to the way we eat our meals. Despite it people learn and do the course of fashion designing from college, institute. The gurukul school of design Jaipur is one of the best fashion designing college in india."

Black beans, just to name a few
And most of these are far less taxing on your pocketbook."
1,Fashion takes us away from our monotonous life.
1,"The disadvantages of fashion: It costs money to be fashionable.
Here are some. Advantages: Wearing stylish, yet clean-cut tailored clothes can cause others to take you more seriously in the office.  when i join my college gurukul school of design i was thinking it would be very costly to become a fashion designer but afer completing 1 year now its fine. "
1,"Here are some. Advantages: Wearing stylish, yet clean-cut tailored clothes can cause others to take you more seriously in the office. Dressing consevatively in a court of law shows respect. Men tent to be liked more by women when they are well groomed. Having a personal style that is unique, yet fashionable can give a person more confidence. Trendily dressed people tend to attract more positive attention. Dressing age appropriately causes people to respect you more. People who are not dressed age appropriately tend to attract scorn and ridicule. Dressing in certain ways can give a woman a more flattering (usually slim hourglass) sillouhette. She can call attention to the parts of herself that she likes (like chiseled abs) and away from those she doesn't (like curvy or flabby thighs). That way, she does not have to feel self conscious. Those who enjoy fashion consider it a form of art. Disadvantages: Among girls and young women, ridiculing each other's outfits and appearances can be a form of bullying. The appearances of the homeless can keep people from offering them jobs. Fashion models tend to be skinny to the extent that it is extremely unhealthy. People may feel uncomfortable physically becayse of peer pressure not to wear a ""dorky"" coat or to wear uncomortable shoes. Fashion can consume money and resources that could be put to uses that help society more. Older children can feel pressured to grow up too fast. 10-year-old girls may want to shave their legs or wear bras. People may support stores that use sweatshop labor because their priority is finding clothes that are ""cute &cheap"" or they think that the clothes from fair-trade stores are ""hippie clothes."" This is not true. Thegreenloop.com and fairiesdance.com ave some really cute clothes that are coop-america (and fashionista) approved. Macy's and H&M have pretty good (although not perfect) track records as to how they treat workers."
1,One advantage of fashion is that it makes us happier.

1,"You do NOT need to know how to sew to be a fashion designer. As a fashion designer, you will be the person who does just that - design clothing. So you will sketch your ideas on paper and then help in choosing the types of fabrics to create them. After this, a pattern maker will create the pattern for your sketch. Then a seamstress will then be the one who will sew it to create what you sketched."

Gosh I'm sorry!
I hope the animal control people picked the dog up."
1,"I am so sorry to hear this! Prayers for a speedy recovery for both.
I have never been attacked to the point of being bitten, but there was a dog that lived between my uncle's house and ours that came at me several times when I rode my bicycle past. One time I couldn't out run him and I used my bike as a shield to keep him away. The owner finally came out and called him home. A few days later it went after another child. About a week later, after the cops did nothing, it went after someone who was carrying a gun."
1,Tisk. How awful. Must have been a shock.  Hope and wishes for a speedy recovery.
1,"Oh my, I'm so sorry to hear this! My dog was attacked by another dog when she was a year old. We were at a campground out of town. I was taking her for a walk when a bigger dog from the camper beside us lunged at her and attacked her. She was bitten around the neck. It was the 4th of July weekend. We found a Vet. In a shabby little office who treated her and said she should stay there a few nights. When I got her back, I immediately took her to my own Vet. Who treated her and she got well with time. Luckily the owner of the other dog took responsibility and paid all the bills."
1,"I'm sorry to hear this. I hope your stepfather and dog will be ok. I wish them both a speedy recovery. None of my dogs or myself have ever been attacked. When my dog Sadie and I walk out the top, I'm usually carrying a pistol in case something bad does happen. Fortunately, I've never had to use it."
1,"At the dog park my dog was attacked twice . . The first time I called her off defending herself . . . The second time the dog pinned he and I couldn't get there fast enough and she was bit a couple times. When I did get there I pulled her out of harms way and yanked their dog off ROUGHLY by the collar and was ready to kick it if it went back after my dog.
Then I looked at the owner who was apologizing . . . Again . . . And I said ""If you cannot control your dog, you have to go . . . NOW.""
The last couple of times I went back to that park, my dog just stayed under the picnic table I was sitting on to afraid (PTSD) to engage with other dogs . . . It's been a couple years so I may try again."

My neice when she was a baby got attacked by her uncle's dog. She had to have many stitches close her face. The doctors did a great job. The only scars left looks like she has cute dimples. Oddly when her son was around the same age, he was attacked by a dog as well. His injuries were not as severe. My ex step dad had a dog who drowned my baby kittens. He tried telling me that's the nature of dogs and he was just ""playing"" with the kittens. Pffft yah right. My mom's stupid dog bites Jr's feet when ever one of us tries to talk to her. I just stopped conversing with my mom cuz she blames everything/everyone BUT the dog. And I don't let my son near it anymore.
Funny side story....
One day my husband, kids and I were Pokehunting at a park when a dog approached us rather abruptly. He told it to get away but it wouldnt. He tried talking nice to it and it growled. So he firmly told it to get away again and it became more aggressive back so he grabbed one of the kids scooters to scare it off and it growled but backed off. We watched it to make sure it left but it wouldn't leave! It kept trying to approach us. My husband was like ""DANG he's persistant!"" My husband said maybe we are blocking his way to his home or something so we went around the other way to get to our car. (I had enough excitement for the night! Lol!) Anyways sure enough where we were originally standing the dog ran back there and as the kids were getting in the car, this dog trotted past us with a bone in its mouth! He was just wanting his bone he buried earlier! ?? So we praised him a good dog! ??"
1,"I m so sorry. I know how you love your dog bcuz I love my cats the same way. Your dog is your baby and a part of your heart. 
Once I remember one I was out for a walk when this dog had gotten away from his chain and came at me. He didn't bite but he growled and showed his teeth. I never walked that way again.
Another time a woman came to our home and let her pit bull out of the car. He came at my cat and actually tried to kill him. It took 3 ppl to get that dog off.                                      My husband threatened to kill the dog. She left in such a hurry, she hit a car on the way out, and that delayed her even longer.              My kitty went to the vet and was ok. The dog just wrenched his jaw."

1,"Psychology is often mistakenly thought to be a highly academic subject, or something only of concern to those who are 'mentally ill'. In fact, psychology is also a practical subject, and the results of academic psychological studies can be applied to everyday life.

Here are a number of ways in which psychology can improve our everyday lives:

Improve Your Motivation
Academic research has given us a wealth of information about what motivates us, and how we can manage our own motivation. The work of academics has been distilled into bite-size pieces of advice that we can use in our daily lives.

Improve Your Communication Skills
It's commonly accepted that non-verbal signals account for a great deal of the meaning we decode during face-to-face conversations. Learning how to read another person's body language is fundamental to ensuring that you convey your meaning effectively to them.

Developing awareness of your own body language will also help you to ensure that your communication is not misread by others.

Make Better Decisions
Understanding what motivates our desires - and what we actually want to get out of life - helps us to make better decisions. Rather than relying upon snap decisions, psychology provides us with tools that we can use to analyse the value we obtain from certain outcomes, and enables us to make judgements that increase the possibility of these outcomes being realised.

Building a Better Memory
Again, academic research has helped our understanding of how memory works, and what techniques we can practice daily in order to improve it. By looking at how we process information when we receive it, we can make sure that memories are stored more effectively."
1,"Psychology helps us to understand people's inner feelings by reading their body language and appearance. It teaches us how to treat people the right way. But sometimes it is easy to go overboard with your analysis of people and scare them away, if you're not careful."

1,Cats are vermin. Give them toys to play with if you wish to waste your money and their (limited) mental abilities. They will be out killing birds and rodents soon afterwards. Then they will be digging up neighbouring gardens to take a dump. Hateful animals in every way.

I hope they both get well soon. I've never been attacked but had a friend once that was.  She had to have many stitches but got ok.
Gosh I'm sorry!
I hope the animal control people picked the dog up."
1,"I am so sorry to hear this! Prayers for a speedy recovery for both.
I have never been attacked to the point of being bitten, but there was a dog that lived between my uncle's house and ours that came at me several times when I rode my bicycle past. One time I couldn't out run him and I used my bike as a shield to keep him away. The owner finally came out and called him home. A few days later it went after another child. About a week later, after the cops did nothing, it went after someone who was carrying a gun."
1,Tisk. How awful. Must have been a shock.  Hope and wishes for a speedy recovery.
1,"Oh my, I'm so sorry to hear this! My dog was attacked by another dog when she was a year old. We were at a campground out of town. I was taking her for a walk when a bigger dog from the camper beside us lunged at her and attacked her. She was bitten around the neck. It was the 4th of July weekend. We found a Vet. In a shabby little office who treated her and said she should stay there a few nights. When I got her back, I immediately took her to my own Vet. Who treated her and she got well with time. Luckily the owner of the other dog took responsibility and paid all the bills."
1,"I'm sorry to hear this. I hope your stepfather and dog will be ok. I wish them both a speedy recovery. None of my dogs or myself have ever been attacked. When my dog Sadie and I walk out the top, I'm usually carrying a pistol in case something bad does happen. Fortunately, I've never had to use it."
1,"At the dog park my dog was attacked twice . . The first time I called her off defending herself . . . The second time the dog pinned he and I couldn't get there fast enough and she was bit a couple times. When I did get there I pulled her out of harms way and yanked their dog off ROUGHLY by the collar and was ready to kick it if it went back after my dog.
Then I looked at the owner who was apologizing . . . Again . . . And I said ""If you cannot control your dog, you have to go . . . NOW.""
The last couple of times I went back to that park, my dog just stayed under the picnic table I was sitting on to afraid (PTSD) to engage with other dogs . . . It's been a couple years so I may try again."

My neice when she was a baby got attacked by her uncle's dog. She had to have many stitches close her face. The doctors did a great job. The only scars left looks like she has cute dimples. Oddly when her son was around the same age, he was attacked by a dog as well. His injuries were not as severe. My ex step dad had a dog who drowned my baby kittens. He tried telling me that's the nature of dogs and he was just ""playing"" with the kittens. Pffft yah right. My mom's stupid dog bites Jr's feet when ever one of us tries to talk to her. I just stopped conversing with my mom cuz she blames everything/everyone BUT the dog. And I don't let my son near it anymore.
Funny side story....
One day my husband, kids and I were Pokehunting at a park when a dog approached us rather abruptly. He told it to get away but it wouldnt. He tried talking nice to it and it growled. So he firmly told it to get away again and it became more aggressive back so he grabbed one of the kids scooters to scare it off and it growled but backed off. We watched it to make sure it left but it wouldn't leave! It kept trying to approach us. My husband was like ""DANG he's persistant!"" My husband said maybe we are blocking his way to his home or something so we went around the other way to get to our car. (I had enough excitement for the night! Lol!) Anyways sure enough where we were originally standing the dog ran back there and as the kids were getting in the car, this dog trotted past us with a bone in its mouth! He was just wanting his bone he buried earlier! ?? So we praised him a good dog! ??"
1,"I m so sorry. I know how you love your dog bcuz I love my cats the same way. Your dog is your baby and a part of your heart. 
Once I remember one I was out for a walk when this dog had gotten away from his chain and came at me. He didn't bite but he growled and showed his teeth. I never walked that way again.
Another time a woman came to our home and let her pit bull out of the car. He came at my cat and actually tried to kill him. It took 3 ppl to get that dog off.                                      My husband threatened to kill the dog. She left in such a hurry, she hit a car on the way out, and that delayed her even longer.              My kitty went to the vet and was ok. The dog just wrenched his jaw."

1,"ANONYMOUS.........FAKE FRIENDS ARE EASY TO COME BY, BUT HOW CAN YOU FIND A TRUE FRIEND?
MAKING FRIENDS IS NOT ALWAYS EASY WHEN YOU ARE YOUNG OR UP IN AGE.  MOST PEOPLE FEEL IT'S IMPORTANT TO HAVE GOOD FRIENDS.  WHAT DO YOU LOOK FOR IN A FRIEND?  WHAT DOES IT TAKE TO HAVE A LASTING FRIENDSHIP?  BUT, THE QUESTION IS HOW CAN YOU BE A GOOD FRIEND?
CONSIDER:   
1.    SHOW THAT YOU REALLY CARE
TRUE FRIENDSHIP INVOLVES COMMITMENT.  IN OTHER WORDS, A GOOD FRIEND FEELS A RESPONSIBILITY TOWARD YOU AND HE REALLY CARES ABOUT YOU.  OF COURSE, SUCH COMMITMENT IS TWO-WAY, AND IT REQUIRES HARD WORK AND SACRIFICE ON BOTH SIDES.    REMEMBER, TO HAVE A GOOD FRIEND, YOU FIRST NEED TO BE A GOOD FRIEND.
2.    WHAT PEOPLE LOOK FOR IN A FRIEND
START BY WANTING TO BE A GOOD FRIEND YOURSELF.  BE GENEROUS IN SHOWING AFFECTION AND PERSONAL INTEREST.  AND BE WILLING TO SACRIFICE YOUR TIME WHEN YOU ARE NEEDED.
THE BIBLE TELLS US:  ""JUST AS YOU WANT MEN TO DO TO YOU,  DO THE SAME WAY TO THEM.  PRACTICE GIVING, AND PEOPLE WILL GIVE TO YOU"".  (LUKE 6:31, 38)
3.    BE A GOOD COMMUNICATOR
A TRUE FRIENDSHIP CANNOT FLOURISH WITHOUT REGULAR COMMUNICATION.  SO TALK TOGETHER ABOUT THE INTERESTS YOU SHARE.  LISTEN TO WHAT YOUR FRIEND HAS TO SAY,  AND RESPECT HIS OPINIONS.  WHENEVER POSSIBLE, COMMEND AND ENCOURAGE HIM.
4.    HAVE REALISTIC EXPECTATIONS
THE CLOSER WE GET TO A FRIEND, THE MORE LIKELY WE ARE TO SEE HIS FLAWS.  OUR FRIENDS ARE NOT PERFECT, BUT NEITHER ARE WE.  THEREFORE, WE SHOULD NEVER EXPECT OR DEMAND PERFECTION FROM THE PEOPLE WE BEFRIEND.  RATHER, IT IS GOOD TO CHERISH THEIR VIRTUES AND TO MAKE ALLOWANCES FOR THEIR  MISTAKES.
5.    WIDEN YOUR CIRCLE OF FRIENDS
IT'S TRUE WE NEED TO BE SELECTIVE ABOUT THE PEOPLE WE BEFRIEND.  BUT THAT DOES NOT MEAN NARROWING OUR CHOICE OF FRIENDS TO THOSE OF A CERTAIN AGE OR UPBRINGING.  TAKE AN INTEREST IN PEOPLE OF ALL AGES, CULTURAL BACKGROUNDS, AND NATIONALITIES CAN TRULY ENRICH OUR LIVES.
WHEN YOU WIDEN YOUR FRIENDS IT GIVES YOU THE OPPORTUNITY TO MATURE AS A PERSON.  WHEN YOU LEARN TO GET ALONG WITH PEOPLE OF ALL AGES THAT WILL MAKE YOU MORE OUTGOING AND ADAPTABLE.
LASTLY;    ACCEPT THE FACT THAT YOUR FRIENDS WILL MAKE MISTAKES.  WHEN PROBLEMS ARISE, WE DO WELL TO RESOLVE THEM QUICKLY AND TRY HARD TO FORGET."

I have never been attacked to the point of being bitten, but there was a dog that lived between my uncle's house and ours that came at me several times when I rode my bicycle past.

My neice when she was a baby got attacked by her uncle's dog. She had to have many stitches close her face. The doctors did a great job. The only scars left looks like she has cute dimples. Oddly when her son was around the same age, he was attacked by a dog as well. His injuries were not as severe. My ex step dad had a dog who drowned my baby kittens. He tried telling me that's the nature of dogs and he was just ""playing"" with the kittens. Pffft yah right. My mom's stupid dog bites Jr's feet when ever one of us tries to talk to her. I just stopped conversing with my mom cuz she blames everything/everyone BUT the dog. And I don't let my son near it anymore.
Funny side story....
One day my husband, kids and I were Pokehunting at a park when a dog approached us rather abruptly. He told it to get away but it wouldnt. He tried talking nice to it and it growled. So he firmly told it to get away again and it became more aggressive back so he grabbed one of the kids scooters to scare it off and it growled but backed off. We watched it to make sure it left but it wouldn't leave! It kept trying to approach us. My husband was like ""DANG he's persistant!"" My husband said maybe we are blocking his way to his home or something so we went around the other way to get to our car. (I had enough excitement for the night! Lol!) Anyways sure enough where we were originally standing the dog ran back there and as the kids were getting in the car, this dog trotted past us with a bone in its mouth! He was just wanting his bone he buried earlier! ?? So we praised him a good dog! ??"

Another time a woman came to our home and let her pit bull out of the car. He came at my cat and actually tried to kill him. It took 3 ppl to get that dog off.

1,my friend got bit in the butt by a dog he’s ok it was pretty funny and sorry about what happened
1,Its good for cats to play with toys. It keeps their mind active and gives them confidence too.
1,Sure. That's why they make them. Toys keep them amused.
1,its always bad for them :D
1,if they enjoy it yes it can be good and fun for them.
1,Cats are vermin. Give them toys to play with if you wish to waste your money and their (limited) mental abilities. They will be out killing birds and rodents soon afterwards. Then they will be digging up neighbouring gardens to take a dump. Hateful animals in every way.

Like what is the quality of services offered by the car dealer, how responsive the company is in addressing customers’ queries, what is its past record in making successful deals, what kind of cars does it deals in, and so on.
Now coming to your question…
Honestly, there are many of such online service providers. From my own personal experience, I would endorse Hamrah Mechanic. I have sold my car via them. And some of my friends have made their purchase through them.
One of the biggest USP of Hamrahmechanic is customer support. The team is very responsive in addressing customers’ problems. To that, they deal in many different types of cars that can fit in wide range of budget! Whether you’re buying or selling the car, you can expect fair pricing. Visit www.hamrah-mechanic.com for more information."

My husband threatened to kill the dog. She left in such a hurry, she hit a car on the way out, and that delayed her even longer.              My kitty went to the vet and was ok. The dog just wrenched his jaw."

Your research will also help you determine whether the company really has the kind of work you want or is one you want to work for. To start off well, smile and give the interviewer a firm handshake if that is the customary greeting. During the interview, concentrate on what the employer needs from you and what you have to offer. Regarding things to avoid, “Don’t fidget or slouch—good posture conveys confidence. Don’t be too informal or overly talkative, and definitely do not use profanity. Maintain eye contact with the interviewer, use natural gestures when you speak, and articulate clearly. Be concise and honest when answering questions, and ask relevant questions about the company and the prospective job. At the end of the interview, if you still want the job, ask for it. Doing so will show your enthusiasm. By following the suggestions outlined above, you may soon have a job!"

1,"Wrinkles are part of our natural process of aging and each one of us is going to have them sooner or later. This doesn't mean we cannot reduce them as much as possible as they can be unpleasant to see.
Wrinkles depend on a lot of factors: Your DNA, your skin's elasticity, personal attitude (if you're constantly stressed, for example), what you eat and drink, and especially what you do to take care of your skin.
When trying to remove or at least diminish wrinkles, it is better to choose a treatment that it as natural as possible, because if you start using products that contain chemicals, they will actually be harmful to your skin. Opt for natural products instead, you could also make your own mask at home with ingrendients like honey, aloe vera olive oil, lemon, cucumber, bananas and avocados.
Coconut oil works well too, I suggest to ask suggestion in a shop you trust because it also depends on the kind of skin you have. Here is a link to some recipes of masks you could do at home with a few ingredients.
As well as taking care of your outer body, take care of your inner one. Pay attention to the foods you eat, avoiding processed foods and alcohol, avoid smoking (among other things, it causes early aging) and drink loads of water.
Use sunscreen to protect your face and body from the damaging effect sunrays can have on your skin not only when you go to the beach but also in your daily life especially in the areas that get more exposed (like your face and neckline, arms and so on).
Get enough sleep and also pay attention to how you sleep.
To avoid wrinkles on your face you should ideally sleep on your back to avoid ""sleep lines"" that might become permanent.
Also, if you have a bigger budget you can include some massages into your routine. You could do them by yourself but maybe an expert knows exactly the spots to target and they way to go.
Hope this helps!"

Yes, most definitely.
Many people who live, or have lived, in toxic mold-infested homes report severe rashes and hives appearing on their bodies, many overnight. Toxic mold is extremely contagious and extremely dangerous and can even be deadly, especially amongst children and the elderly and infirm. The mold is particularly prevalent in homes that are susceptible to damp and those where the wall lining is non-porous, denying it of oxygen, thus giving the wall no opportunity to breath. Toxic mold, or stachbybotrys chartarum to give it its scientific name, occurs when water damage, excessive humidity, water leaks, condensation or flooding is present.
Treatment of mold allergy hives varies on the severity of the complaint. You could try over the counter medicines that are available at chemists and drugstores, or antihistamines that can be taken to treat symptoms such as hives and rashes. Soothing creams can be used to reduce the itchiness of the hives but, in more serious cases, steroids will be prescribed by your doctor, however these can have side effects.
If you believe toxic mold is present in your home, a thorough home inspection will be able to uncover the dangerous mold form, which should be professionally treated. Toxic molds produce chemicals called mycotoxins that not only cause hives and rashes, but can also bring on seizures, respiratory problems, unusual bleeding and severe fatigue. Toxic mold will only grow on wood, paper and cotton products, but a mold-infested home can become a lethal environment for those prone to allergy problems. Once black mold begins to fester in a home, spores are released by the mold clusters. These microscopic cells quickly become airborne and travel through air conditioning and heating systems. In many cases the only solution to the problem is to demolish the building and rebuild."
0,"I moved into a older home in 2009 november. Over the course over the next two months I stared to develop what I thought was a rash. Turns out they were hives. Seen allergists, Immunoligist, primary care, multiple ER visits. The hives affected my breathing also. Even made me emmotionally distressed. I had delt with chronic uticaria for almost seven months.I was on at one time, Zantac 150 twice a day, hydroxyzine 10mg 8 times a day, allegra once a day and, advaire twice daily. Was allergy tested, blood tested from multiple doctors. Stoped from eating, wheat, fish, eggs, milk. I was told they may only be able to treat the symptoms. My kids started getting sick also. No hives just respitory symptoms. I decidede to move to my parents home which was near by to see if somthing in the house was an issue. This house had mold. I worked in the construction field and was remodling this dream home. Two weeks out of this house and not a single hive. I am currently down to one zantac 150 once before bed. It took a little time for the hives to stop completel, I have none now. Just as a test went back to the house to put in a couple of Large HEPA filters to see if I could make the house livable. 8 hours after I went to the house hives started showing up again. Hope this helps. I looked at several forums out of desparation. I believe that mold caused this. Definitly something in the house."
0,"I have had hives since 2001. The home I was living in had toxic mold. When we decided to buy the home that we were leasing, we had an inspection done. The inspector found mold. Then we had a mold inspection. It was determined that there was toxic mold in the house. The mold was on the back of the dry wall about 1'' thick. My husband developed COPD and died. I was put on Diflucan, which worked for 5 years. The doctors told me that there is no way to get rid of this type of infection, and that the infection would eventually become resistant to Diflucan, which is what happened after 5 years. My health insurance was cancelled when the diagnosis came back in 2002. This year I have health insurance, but the new doctors took me off the Diflucan, so now I am covered in hives again. They are giving me drugs to suppress the hives, which worked for a few months. Even after fungus became resistant , the Diflucan still suppressed more hives than Hydroxyzine and Fexofenadine HCl that my current doctors subscribed.

The first group of doctors ran a fungal panel, that registered how many antibodies for each of 500 fungi where in my blood. About 4 fungi had 3 to 5 times the amount of antibodies normally found in blood, so that is why they decided to try Diflucan. They were going to send me to Rheumatoid Arthritis specialist, until we discovered the toxic mold in our home. The new doctors say that there is no way to test for fungus, and the presence of antibodies does not mean that there is an active infection.

I thought I had arthritis before I was put on the Diflucan, and I was also having some nerve problems. I would fall and drop things because I would momentarily loose control of nerves in my arms or legs. All those problems went away while I was on Diflucan. Now the nerve problems are slowly coming back, but so far adding golden flax, fish oil, primrose oil, walnuts, and olives to my diet has helped with most of the joint pain.

The other day I went to see two naturopaths who are in to herbs. One graduated from UC Irvine and the other received his training at Trinity. I am unfamiliar with this discipline, but they did offer a solution. It would cost $200 to $250 for 3 to 6 months and then $50 a month to control the condition after that. They claimed that the fungus would not become resistant to this treatment.

I currently had lost my full time job and I am only working part time, so I don't have the money to pursue this course of action at the moment. I have started looking to alternative medicine since doctors belonging the AMA don't seem to be able to help me, and sometimes the hives are so bad that they leave bruises, not to mention that they are all over my body. The good news is that the hives that are on parts of my body that are exposed to sun light go away till the sun goes down. So I look normal during daylight hours.

My advice is to get away from any possible source of toxic mold. And if you find a solution please post it. I am told that 5% of the population suffers from chronic hives and the medical profession has been unable to find a cause. Untreated the itching from hives can just about drive one insane, so I am definitely looking for a solution. I have also begun to wonder if fungus might be the cause of some of the autoimmune diseases, since some of my symptoms mimic some of those diseases. I wish you the best of luck at putting an end to your chronic hives."
0,"To the person who posted :
Me and my partner moved into our house about 4 months ago, we had noticed that their was a mold build up in the corner of the dining room directly under our bathroom. We thought nothing of it at first as the house is rented so eventualy it would be dealt with by the landlord. However my partner has been breaking out in severe hives but I don't, could it be the mold that is causing her outbreaks, even though I'm not affected by it?

The answer to that is yes. About 4 years ago me my partner moved into a really nice townhome, and all was great. The first night there I took a shower and the water 'stung' which had never happened before, I didnt think much of it, I mean it was weird but I figured I was just sore from working out. WHen I went downstairs I found a leak had happened while I was in the shower and water was everywhere...after cleaning it up, my hands burned and that was about the time when I realized something was wrong with the water, and told myself to call my landlord in the morning. Long story short...I came down with sever hives, face swelling, hand swelling, leg/feet swelling...and covered in hives. Our landlord refused to believe anything was wrong, and kept putting it off until I finally busted part of the ceiling off and exposed a HUGE mess of toxic black mold.
My advice to you is, if your girlfriend is having hives and or trouble breathing, its time to call your landlord and do something. My partner had lung problems for years after we moved out of that place. Just because you show no physical signs like your girlfriend (IF it is mold that she is allergic to) does not mean that you are safe from whatever is affecting her. I wish you guys the best of luck."

Here's the game plan. Bleach all clothes. Lysol carpets furniture. And most important, the nuclear option. An Ozone Generator. I'd never heard of such a thing. It took a while to actually find a place that rents them. Ozone is the one thing that kills mold dead. When you use it, no plants or pets can be around. You can't be in the room when it's running. Do some research on it and you will see what I'm talking about. Hope this helps and good luck  "
1,"It can MOST definitely give you hives and rashes - I lived for 7 months on prednisone because the doctors couldnt figure out why I was getting hives 24/7 -to the point that I was in the E.R. Every other week- I was unrecognizable because of the hives. It can get really ugly - really quick!! I was renting a townhome in Irvine, CA - they had water damage -which they said was little and they dryed out quickly- well a little more investigation there was toxic black mold in the master bathroom(in the walls,under the cabinet)! Really look around - the docs can't do as much as you when it comes to this!!! MOVE OUT! I'm still dealing with hives (they are a lot better -and go away on there own )so thats a plus. But once you move out -do a whole body cleanse... And keep pushing for them to give you an antifungal to kill the mold in your body!  

Good luck -I know how it feels!"

1,my friend got bit in the butt by a dog he’s ok it was pretty funny and sorry about what happened
1,"Omg I'm so sorry!
I hope they both get well soon. I've never been attacked but had a friend once that was.  She had to have many stitches but got ok.
Gosh I'm sorry!
I hope the animal control people picked the dog up."
1,"I am so sorry to hear this! Prayers for a speedy recovery for both.
I have never been attacked to the point of being bitten, but there was a dog that lived between my uncle's house and ours that came at me several times when I rode my bicycle past. One time I couldn't out run him and I used my bike as a shield to keep him away. The owner finally came out and called him home. A few days later it went after another child. About a week later, after the cops did nothing, it went after someone who was carrying a gun."

1,"Oh my, I'm so sorry to hear this! My dog was attacked by another dog when she was a year old. We were at a campground out of town. I was taking her for a walk when a bigger dog from the camper beside us lunged at her and attacked her. She was bitten around the neck. It was the 4th of July weekend. We found a Vet. In a shabby little office who treated her and said she should stay there a few nights. When I got her back, I immediately took her to my own Vet. Who treated her and she got well with time. Luckily the owner of the other dog took responsibility and paid all the bills."

1,"At the dog park my dog was attacked twice . . The first time I called her off defending herself . . . The second time the dog pinned he and I couldn't get there fast enough and she was bit a couple times. When I did get there I pulled her out of harms way and yanked their dog off ROUGHLY by the collar and was ready to kick it if it went back after my dog.
Then I looked at the owner who was apologizing . . . Again . . . And I said ""If you cannot control your dog, you have to go . . . NOW.""
The last couple of times I went back to that park, my dog just stayed under the picnic table I was sitting on to afraid (PTSD) to engage with other dogs . . . It's been a couple years so I may try again."

My neice when she was a baby got attacked by her uncle's dog. She had to have many stitches close her face. The doctors did a great job. The only scars left looks like she has cute dimples. Oddly when her son was around the same age, he was attacked by a dog as well. His injuries were not as severe. My ex step dad had a dog who drowned my baby kittens. He tried telling me that's the nature of dogs and he was just ""playing"" with the kittens. Pffft yah right. My mom's stupid dog bites Jr's feet when ever one of us tries to talk to her. I just stopped conversing with my mom cuz she blames everything/everyone BUT the dog. And I don't let my son near it anymore.
Funny side story....
One day my husband, kids and I were Pokehunting at a park when a dog approached us rather abruptly. He told it to get away but it wouldnt. He tried talking nice to it and it growled. So he firmly told it to get away again and it became more aggressive back so he grabbed one of the kids scooters to scare it off and it growled but backed off. We watched it to make sure it left but it wouldn't leave! It kept trying to approach us. My husband was like ""DANG he's persistant!"" My husband said maybe we are blocking his way to his home or something so we went around the other way to get to our car. (I had enough excitement for the night! Lol!) Anyways sure enough where we were originally standing the dog ran back there and as the kids were getting in the car, this dog trotted past us with a bone in its mouth! He was just wanting his bone he buried earlier! ?? So we praised him a good dog! ??"

The quality control on Dell and HP is horrendous, the customer support is an indian call center overseas paid cheaper than usual.
I use a Mac for work, with Unix you can’t find a better Linux machine. Editing videos, pictures, and audio are all superior with Apple’s line of software.  They work better on a Mac that’s fully optimize for the software even with lower “dope specs”. The keyboard and trackpad are superior to everything on the market. The retina screen is second to none. The frame itself, none of that wobble or creeking like a windows laptop.

Didn't see anything so he kept going. He hears the voice again ""Jesus is watching you."" The guy looks again with his light and sees a bird. ""Oh it's just a bird"" the robber said. Then he said to the bird ""what's your name pretty bird?"" The bird replied ""Moses."" The robber laughs and says ""MOSES! Thats a funny name for a bird! Who the heck would name their bird Moses!?!""

1,"SEO keywords are the ideas and topics that makes it possible for the users to find you via a search engine. In another term, it's a phrase or idea that make your content relevant and define the content of your web page. It is very important to every aspect of your SEO campaign. From Metadata description to content quality, keywords are used in everything because they are the primary source which boosts your ranking as well as online visibility. And the keyword research is the process of finding the right keywords for your post and the keyword volume tells roughly how many people are using this keyword for searching.

1,"Tampa SEO – Google recently announced on January 17, 2018 that they will be prioritizing mobile page speed ranking factor over the next several months. Google confirms they are launching an update in July 2018. It will mainly effect slow loading mobile websites. Some slow loading results may still show up high in mobile search provided they contain the most relevant content, however, expect to see more prominent rankings for fast loading AMP sites (Accelerated Mobile Pages). Google Map Optimization Tampa
If you are unsure whether your site is prepared for the mobile Google PageSpeed insights, GTMetrix.comand get a free SEO audit on our website. If you find your site needs improvement and your not sure where to begin, please contact us for a free consultation.
Our Tampa SEO Rank Index measures SERP fluctuations for over 5000+ domains and keywords that our system monitors daily. It is one of the tools you can find under your ranking portal in our Google algorithm monitoring service.
We are now also logging SERP structure changes and track Google SERP features to determine whether ranking fluctuations are potentially being caused by changes in the type or number of vertical search engine results (e.g., Images, videos, News, Maps, etc.) that Google includes in their first page results.
On March 3rd, our SEO rank index discovered increased rank fluctuations on both desktop and mobile search results. While the uptick in rank fluctuations was initially moderate, the index caught an unusual and highly significant upsurge on March 9th. According to the index, fluctuations reached a level of 99 (out of 100) on desktop and 92 (out of 100) on mobile. After monitoring this over the last several days  the fluctuations have seemed to tapper off.
Also note, on March 12th, Search Engine Land reported that Google, uncharacteristically, confirmed the update as being related to its core algorithm (thereby explaining the unusually high fluctuations levels of March the 9th).
So without question, Google is emphasizing site speed, mobile responsiveness, on-page optimizations even more than we’ve seen in the past.  If you’re not sure if your site is bullet proofed for the recent updates, contact us for a free initial consultation."

0,"It’s not easy promoting a website, and many beginners will find that it’s a challenging and head-scratching process. The easiest and most popular way to promote your website and increase traffic to it is by using a method called Search Engine Optimisation (SEO). This post provides some simple SEO tips for beginners to help them promote their website.
Without going into technical details (this is for beginners, after all!), search engines are configured in such a way that every website must follow certain standards and updates for the common good of the customers (visitors). SEO is hard – if it was easy then all websites would be optimized amazingly! Hence we felt the need to share some simple SEO tips for beginners as it can all get a bit confusing.
By using SEO, you’ll find that it’s much easier to build an online presence for your website. This is done by boosting its “search equity”. The main objective of Search Engine Optimisation is, quite simply, to be found more easily by your target audience via the likes of Google and Bing. As such, search engines are recommending optimized websites for relevant searches conducted by using keywords.
1. Start building quality back-links
A straight-forward, yet well-known, method to help optimize your website is to build quality backlinks to obtain better SEO results. Before building backlinks, it’s important to check out how each backlink will react to your website and which ones are the best for you. You can check out more information about this topic on the awesome Moz. This simple SEO tip can be tricky to get going – we offer this service for high-ranking sites, as well as nice industry sector sites.
2. Social Media Marketing
Another effective SEO technique that you can apply to your website is social media marketing. Thanks to the advancements in technology and social media, many people use social media networks to look for information, research products before they buy them, share their experiences, etc.. By extending the keyword strategy to other social channels including Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, Pinterest, alongside other digital marketing, content marketing or E-mail marketing campaigns, you can be sure that your site will receive significantly increased traffic than without social media activities. This is one of the really obvious and must-do simple SEO tips!
3. Use unique brand images
By integrating good images, you will make your website much more visually engaging while also helping to get backlinks. Instead of using Flash, include unique branded images (which can be done quickly and easily now thanks to the various online tools we can use for free) so that if anyone uses your images on their site, they will have your logo and URL on them.
4. Keep an eye your competitors
Before implementing any SEO technique, you should take some time to analyze the existing traffic on your site. It would also make sense to check out your competitors.
5. Content must be unique
It’s said that “content is King” – Content Marketing helps attract more visitors and prospects to your site, so the best thing to do is to create original content (read our eBook series, Content Marketing Matters, for some great tips and insights). Make sure your content is related to your website, relevant to your target audience, and provides added value for your visitors. It is also important to consider keywords research and focus on long-tail keywords so that search engines will index your site.
6. Branding is important
Many users often stay mesmerized by an industry name or brand. Even the name itself, tagline or the logo can make a big difference. If you want to keep more people on your website, choose a name or tagline that will define your business and website – be distinctive and try to include a strong keyword in your strapline. You’ll be surprised at what can help boost your traffic and brand awareness – perhaps one of the less obvious simple SEO tips!
7. Measure your website traffic
If you want your website to be SEO friendly, you’ll need Google Analytics. Google Analytics helps your website track and monitor the number of visitors drawn to your site and their activities once there. Aside from increasing traffic by helping you better understand it, adding Google Analytics will improve the conversion rates and help you identify which pages are popular and which aren’t, so you can take steps to improve.
By implementing various SEO techniques, you’re making sure that your website is easy to understand for both the search engine algorithms and your visitors. It will also help the search engine identify your web page so that you can attract more organic traffic too."
1,It doesn't matter in which kind of services your business deals. An SEO website too can be promoted over various social media platforms. The thing requires only to is buying more Instagram followers to attract genuine followers over the site. You can look for other reliable ideas over the Instagram.
1,"Hello!!
What is SEO?
The abbreviation of SEO is Search Engine Optimization. SEO is one challenge that most of the companies face. If your content is Search Engine Optimized, then it will help in ranking your website on one of the top organic results.
Generally, most users click on the first 3–5 results on Page 1 in case of searching for anything in Google or Yahoo. The tendency to move to the next few pages is very minimum, therefore a brand should consistently keep optimizing their site on a regular basis to reflect on top organic results.
How do we do it?
SEO might sound a little difficult to crack. But it is not as hard as it seems like.
Before writing the website content or any content, based on the topic, filter the keywords that a user can use while searching. With the help of Keyword Planner by Google, put down your product and get the top results of keywords. Try to use them in your content.
Also, while your website or webpage is being HTMLised, make sure you give your page, a unique URL with a specific keyword, give your webpage a page title, meta tag, meta description.
Google reads these codes and the keywords that are linked on your page will marry the content a user searches for if both tally then you win!! You will see your webpage on the organic results.
Make sure there are no broken links. All the links attached should render fine on desktop and mobile.
Also, add Alt tag and Alt description to the images linked on your web pages.
Using long tail keywords help more in SEO. You can use short tail keywords in the main content.
Your webpage should also be mobile responsive.
Connect your site to your social channels. If you want to rank your site in google quickly, then the first social site that you should give emphasis on is Google plus.

Google plus is the best social media for ranking your website in google. Create your business account in Google plus and then start producing and sharing content which will drive traffic to your websites.
Google+ will help SEO and it will also rank your page immediately. Ranking your page is important if you want more visitors to your site.

In order to get traffic to your website from your Google plus account, you need lots of followers. And to advertise and sell your products via Google you need a lot of good reviews.

If you have tons of followers then your followers will easily see your post and ratings about your products. To sell good product reviews is very important. Those who have lots of followers, they don’t need to spend extra money to get a number of reviews for some average products.

But those who are new on this platform, they face a lot of struggle to get their products reviewed. One of the easiest ways to solve this is to buy Google plus reviews.

One of the trusted sources to buy Google plus reviews is promoting team. They are a bunch of professionals who know how to deliver their services in the right way.
Once all these points are noted and checked, then slowly keep updating your keywords in the backend and constantly keep your page updated and social pages active for it to reflect organically. You are all set to promote your website organically with SEO."

1,"To find out you WASSCE private index number, you would have to contact either your school or the examinations authority itself. Alternatively, your index number should be displayed on relevant paperwork you have. In order to sit your examinations, you need to have your WASSCE private index number to hand. If you have lost a record of it for any reason, you shouldn't worry - an advisor at your school will be able to sort the issue out for you.

The WASSCE

The WASSCE - or West African Senior School Certificate Examination - is a standardized test sat by most secondary school students in Anglophone West African countries. It can not be sat by individuals in any other worldwide locations. Two different exams are available: One in December, one in June. The results of these exams are made available to schools and candidates a few months after them taking place.

A range of topics can be examined in the WASSCE. Some are compulsory to all candidates sitting the exam, such as science, mathematics and social studies. Others, such as woodwork, accounting and typewriting, are optional. Most candidates will sit the compulsory topics as well as around three extra additional areas of study. This gives students a broad range of knowledge upon leaving secondary education.

Controversy

The WASSCE system is not perfect. Students are regularly caught cheating, as are examiners, some of whom will be willing to accept bribes. There have been cases in which examiners have passed answers to students or admitted their papers under special circumstances. The marking of the WASSCE is in many cases very inaccurate and it is difficult for students to do anything about this. Overall, the WASSCE needs many improvements before it can gain an excellent reputation."

1,"The diamonds are usually held in place in rings and earrings by little arms called prongs.

How you separate the precious stone from the setting depends on what material the prongs are made of.

In most cases, you (or a jeweler) should be able to bend the prongs open, using a pair of jeweler's tweezers, without too much hassle.

Removing your diamond from its setting
To pry a diamond out of its setting, you'll need to bend back the prongs that are holding it in place. This can usually be done using a tool known as jeweler's tweezers.

You can see examples of this implement (as well as other tools of the trade) at jewellertools.co.uk.

In certain cases, you may need to hit up the setting to make the prongs more malleable. Although the process should be fairly straightforward, I'd recommend taking your ring to a jeweler, as a professional will make sure no damage is done to the stone or the setting.

Some jewelers even offer the simple procedure free-of-charge, whilst others may charge a small fee.

Considering that you may have to invest in specialist equipment for removing the diamond yourself, it may be wiser to invest that money in the services of someone who knows what they're doing.

1,"Yes, there are lenders out there who will lend money to people who have bad credit and low credit score, but they do come with a very high interest rate.

You may end up paying back a lot more than you originally borrowed.

Getting a loan with a bad credit rating
Another drawback is that they are only short-term loans that have to be paid back perhaps quicker than you would like which could pose a problem to you.

It also depends what you need the money for and how much you want to borrow as the amount that you can borrow will vary from lender to lender so it is important that you find one that will lend you the amount you want.

There are Bad Credit Personal Loans available that can be secured or unsecured. A secured loan will need some form of collateral up front against the amount you want to borrow as a kind of insurance but it will have a low interest rate.

With an unsecured loan you will have no need to put anything up as collateral but the interest rate of the loan will be considerably higher.

If you need the money to purchase a new car there are Bad Credit Car Loans available. Again these can be secured or unsecured but you do not need to put any collateral as the loan is taken out against the car. So should you miss any repayments you will be in danger of losing your car.

How can I get a loan with a low credit score?
Payday Loans are easy to find online but are only for short-term use and are to tide you over until your next payday should you find yourself short, for whatever reason. All you have to do is to prove that you are employed and have a regular income coming in every month and be at least 18 years of age or older.

If you only need a short-term loan there are lenders online who will lend you the money you need without a credit search being done.

If you are really desperate and as a last resort only there are private money lenders out there but should be avoided at all costs as they charge really high interest rates."
1,"Prosper.com will... But you can't have a lower credit score than 520.

I have what is rated as D credit in the low 600's and I have seen a lot of High Risk loans there or no credit ones... I wouldn't ask for a big loan to begin with though.

I only asked for the lowest amount I needed and that was 1000 dollars, the repay is 36 dollars a month for 3 years at 18% since it was what my state could charge... Check it out! They are for real..."
1,"You should get a bad credit loan. In that case even if you have a bad credit history or can not pay off, you can easily survive."
1,Only scammers have been contacting me have not yet found not even one genuine loan lender yet in 5 years.
1,Prosper.com has a credit requirement of 640.
1,"There are a lot of lenders who lend you with bad credit, but their interest rates are pretty high."
1,"Hard money lenders can lend money with bad credit also. They are not asking for credit score also. So, you can easily get loan from them without credit score also. You also can obtain loan with unverified income information."
1,There are definitely companies that will give you a loan with a bad credit score. They tend to have high interest rates though and they are set up to be used for emergencies. Make sure that you have a solid payment plan before you go for any of these loans. I hope this helps!
1,Even If you have bad credit history then you can apply for payday loan with no credit check and you will receive the loan without any credit check easily.

Reduces the manpower requirement: The number of persons required for performing various organizational activities will be reduced by using a computer system.
Increased ability to perform computations: Computers perform computations with a very high speed.
Diligence: Being a machine, it does not suffer from boredom, tiredness or lack of concentration, even if millions of computations are to be performed by a computer. It performs the calculations with same accuracy and speed.

Disadvantages:

· Power failure, computer viruses and hackers are the inherent problems of using computerized systems;
·Once data been input into the system, automatically the output are obtained hence the data being input needs to be validated for accuracy and completeness, we should not forget concept of GIGO (Garbage In(Input) Garbage out ( Output) and
· Accounting system not properly set up to meet the requirement of the business due to badly programmed or inappropriate software or hardware or personnel problems can caused more havoc and
· Danger of computer fraud if proper level of control and security whether internal and external are not properly been instituted."
1,"A typical file-based system or filesystem is an excellent way of categorizing and storing different types of information; a filesystem will store files according to text names that are readable by human beings...not just a computer processor. In a file-based system, there will be options to alter and retrieve data at any time, through the use of computer commands. Every individual file will have it own name and will be called a computer file. Data files, or computer files, will then be placed on an organized system that begins at the top, with a master group of files, and tapers downward to single files. In this way, every file belongs somewhere, and each file can be accessed as part of a larger group.

This efficient system of data organization is created through the use of hardcode programs that latch onto needed information stored in a specific region. While virtual ""folders"" filled with individual document files are used, data can also be saved in a single-file format (also called a flat-file system). A file-based system is a great way to find documents on a daily basis, and a beneficial method of preserving a collection of important information from myriad sources, departments, and authors.

A file-based computer system can be used with a variety of computer hardware and accessories, including:

• CD-ROMs
• USB sticks
• External Hard Drives
• Main Hard Disks

Adding insertions, deletions, and updates to files is simple and organized when a file-based system is employed. Often, there will be little need for full-time IT staff to monitor and safeguard the database; updates and checks can be performed as needed. However, a certain amount of security concerns may exist with these file-based systems, as they have a tendency to be more prone to being hacked or corrupted."

To calculate daily calorie requirements, first of basal metabolic rate (BMR) is calculated by following formula and then follow strictly these calories intake.
BMR for Men=66+(13.7 X wt in kg)+(5 X ht in cm)-(6.8X age in years)
BMR for women =655+(9.6 X wt in kg)+(1.8 X ht in cm)-(4.7 X age in years).
Now multiply your BMR with activity multiplier.
Sedentary = BMR X 1.2
Lightly active = BMR X 1.375
Moderate Active = BMR X 1.55
Very active = BMR X 1.725
Extraordinary active = BMR X 1.9.
In this way you can calculate your daily calories requirements. If you want to reduce or increase weight then put your desired weight in the weight space of the BMR formula."
1,"How To Lose Fat – The Basic Principles Of Fat Loss
Many people want to know how to lose fat, which could be
for a number of reasons such as: To become fitter, healthier, back in good
shape or look more attractive.
Also, fat loss is very important for people who want to get a muscular or
toned body. It’s important to get rid of excess fat when building muscle so
that you can have a good level of leanness and  muscle definition that
will result in an impressive  physique.
If your body has a lot more
fat than it should, then this is caused by a combination of your genetics,
eating habits and lifestyle that provides the way for your body to
consistently store excess fat.
However, if you want to get rid of fat to get your body to become leaner,
then this can be done by learning the basic principles of fat loss and using a
good fat burning diet and exercise program that will work for you.
Just likegaining muscle mass, losing fat takes time and discipline.
You must be consistently following a good fat loss program that is designed
properly to fit your personal circumstances to reach success.
Below I outline the basic principles of how to lose fat that all fat
loss/weight loss plans and programs have to address.
How Excess Fat Is Stored In The Body
Although losing fat is the focus of this article it’s important to first
have an understanding of how you get fat on your body in the first place. This
is necessary if you seriously want to get lean and stay lean.
Without elaborating, you get fat anytime you consume more calories than your
body burns in a day. Calories are contained in different quantities in all
types of foods that we eat and drink, and they provide energy for your
body to do everything.
For example, a small size bar of Chocolate contains a lot more calories
than a big Apple. Therefore, eating lots of chocolate will result in a large
amount of calories accumulating in your body quickly. Any time your total daily
calorie intake is more than your total daily energy expenditure, you’ll gain
weight.
    “Some foods contain a lot more calories than
others. Therefore, they’ll make you fat faster“
Whenever you eat lots of calories and do not use them all up (burn energy),
mainly because you did not do enough physical activity, the extra calories will
be stored as fat.
Consuming more calories than the amount your body needs to maintain it’s
weight is also known as a calorie surplus. A calorie surplus normally leads to
weight gain because if the body is not using up calories, it’ll store them. And
unless you do proper resistance training to build muscle with the extra
calories, they will be stored as fat.
To put it in a simple equation:
More calories In, less calories out = weight gain
More calories out, less calories in = weight loss
Resistance exercise plus weight gain = muscle mass gain (with possibly
some fat)
Weight gain with no resistance exercise = Mostly fat stored
So the above shows that calories consumed in excess results in weight gain
because the extra calories are not used up by the body to supply for energy
demands. And it also shows that the only way weight gain would not be mostly
fat stored is when resistance training is applied to build muscle mass with the
extra calories.
How To Lose Fat Is To Make Use Of The Right Diet And Exercise Plan
To Achieve A Caloric Deficit
A caloric deficit is a must to lose fat stored in the body. A caloric
deficit simply means consuming less calories than the amount your body burns,
and this actually is the most important factor for losing body fat. The longer
your body remains in a healthy calorie deficit, the more fat you’ll burn.
How To Create A Caloric Deficit?
You create a calorie deficit by consuming less calories in your diet and/or
exercising more to burn additional calories so that you are consuming less
calories than you expend. You first have to calculate your calorie maintenance level or total daily energy expenditure
to be able to create a deficit.
When your body is not getting enough calories from your food intake to use
for energy demands, it’ll start burning the fats that’s stored in your body.
That’s the reason a calorie deficit is crucial to achieve fat loss.
Although the calorie deficit is the paramount factor for fat loss, there are
a lot more elements that are also very important.
Some people, after learning that a calorie deficit is what they need to lose
body fat, may decide to simply cut lots of calories from their diet by removing
almost all foods that are high in calories and start exercising aggressively
for hours everyday.
This may sound like the right thing to do for losing fat fast, but it’s not
the correct approach to take for long term, sustainable fat loss and success in
getting lean.
You Must Have A Good Healthy Plan To
Lose Fat Correctly
The right thing to do when you want to start losing body fat is to take time
to figure out which fat loss plan is right for you by taking into consideration
other factors such as maintaining good health, maintaining muscle mass, your
body type, your ability to stick to the plan etc.
Working along with a well structured, safe, suitable and effective plan to
lose fat will greatly increase your chances of successfully reducing the amount
of body fat that you want to get rid of, because it’ll make your efforts more
likely to produce positive results without negative side effects.
All fat loss programs must be structured properly to allow the users to
create a calorie deficit to burn stored fat, but there are different ways of
creating the deficit. A combination of proper nutrition and exercise is the
best way to lose fat and get additional benefits.
Everyone’s circumstances and goals are different and would need to use the
right fat loss plan that’ll work best for them. A fat loss plan can be as
simple as eating less food and walking more everyday or as complex as tracking
every nutrition component in your diet and performing strategic cardio and
weight lifting workouts.
Of course, the type of plan that you use will impact the results that you
get. But don’t think about results alone when considering which approach to
use. Try to be objective by looking at everything that will affect you such as
your personal preferences, body type, lifestyle, schedules etc.
So on a final note, losing fat is accomplished by a calorie deficit and
anyone can do it, but you must use the right diet and exercise program that
meet your individual needs best to reach success."

1,"You're making more difficult than it needs to be.

All diets, regardless if they are counting points(weight watchers), food exchanges, calories, or have you eating certain foods which inhibit you from eating more calories(calories are a unit of measurement for energy) work on the same principle. Get the body to burn more calories than it takes in via manipulation of energy balance.
What is energy balance? It's a term used to describe the balance of energy(again measured in calories in the U.S. Or Joules in Asia/Europe) with either it being negative or positive.
When it's positive, you are in a energy surplus(excess calories) than your body requires to function and the excess is ""stored"" in body fat.  If you wants to track your weight on daily basis then use this weight loss tracker app through which you can easily came to know about your calories level."
1,"Hi There,    Following tips you may find helpful.    Eat healthy
You need to eat healthy to loose weight.  A healthy, well-balanced diet is the best way to lose excess weight i.e. A balanced diet of protein, unsaturated fat,  carbohydrates (potatoes, wholegrain bread and pasta), vegetables and fruit. It should be low in saturated fat, salt and sugar.
  It is good to eat more fruit and vegetables  
A study in the Journal of the American Dietetic Association found that slim people ate one more portion of fruit a day than those who were overweight. So eat lots of fruits.    You may find more tips on the following webpage  www.subodhgupta.com   "
1,"1. Eating the right food
2. Sleep 6-8 hours
3. Avoid Stress
4. Mild Exercise"
1,"Weight Maintenance:

You will maintain your current weight by keeping your daily caloric intake at or around your maintenance level.
Maintenance calories = bodyweight x 15. (ex: 130 poundsx15 = 1,950 calories/day).
Fat Loss:

You lose fat by maintaining a caloric deficit over time.  Try eating 500 calories less than your maintenance each day(in this example, that would be 1,450)...that will create a 3,500 calorie/week deficit which is the amount of calories you need to burn to lose 1 pound.
Note: When in a deficit, you can't control how much of the weight loss is fat, how much is muscle loss or how much is simply water weight loss...

When you first start a diet you will see a lot of water weight loss in the first week....

To avoid muscle loss, do resistance training and don't maintain too large a caloric deficit (500 calories below is a safe deficit)...remember, cardio can further reduce your deficit past 500 calories/day...this is fine if you have more weight on you to lose though.
Lean Weight Gain:

Adding lean mass to your frame comes from breaking down your muscle tissues by lifting heavy weights and eating in a caloric surplus to provide the nutrients to build the muscle.
Again, to minimize the fat gain when in a surplus of calories, don't eat more than 500 calories OVER your maintenance daily...Eating 200-300 calories over maintenance will ensure most of the weight is lean mass.
Make sure you're getting at least your bodyweight in grams of protein.  So if you weigh 130 pounds, get at least 130g of protein...

Protein is necessary to build lean tissue.
Also, make sure you are lifting a weight that is heavy (you can just barely lift about 8x on the first set), if you don't lift heavy, those extra calories are more likely to go to fat storage than repairing/building muscle tissue.
You can find more info on the proper way to go about any of these goals here."

1,"I know of many people who don’t believe in any gods, so by default, they put everything else in front of what they don’t believe."
1,"Sure, but lets be specific . . Which God are you referring to?
I also know people who put all worldly things before Santa, The Easter Bunny, and ""Zorg"" the magical Space Pixie . . .
The ""Worldly things"" you refer to are tangible objects we can interact with . . . Like cell phones, Televisions, Cars . . . They require no ""Faith"" to interact or believe in.
To me, it seems much more odd to believe in unverifiable magic claims, then it does to have actual KNOWLEDGE about the material things we interact with  . . . Daily."
1,"Yes, God isn't as popular as he use to be. Even more so, they seek to be famous themselves through facebook, twitter etc as Aleister Crowley said ""Everyone's A Star."" 
Vanity, devils favourite sin :)

1,"Q ""Do you know any people that put celebrities and all the worldly things before God?""
It is people who make the celebrities and then they idolise them, will nearly do anything for them or to be like them and even almost worship them. They wouldn't be celebrities if people didn't turn them into celebrities in the first place. People can be strange."
1,"I do. They are from the vain world. Glamour is the ultimate at any cost. 
Further, Glamour is there God and the God demands are of drinks, drugs and sex to attain oneness with God."

1,"You make a conscious decision to change it. As for making life easier? You will have to still face all of life's challenges, they just won't drag you down, and can make finding solutions easier.
I have a friend who was always complaining about life. A year ago someone gave her a book about gratitude and positive thinking. One of her biggest complaints was her job. Once she started looking at the positives, she realized it wasn't her job she hated. She actually loved what she did. It was her employer that was the problem. She starting looking around for another place to work. She found one. Not only is the boss better, but the co-workers are happier making for a much better work environment. AND she now makes more money and has better hours.
Focusing on what is good about your life makes it easier to fix what is wrong.
She started her change by starting her day listing 3-5 things was thankful for. She posted them on Facebook. Some friends liked it others complained. Those that complained are not getting much attention nowadays. Those that supported her are. Surrounding yourself with positive people helps. I really enjoyed her positive posts because it made me think about what I am grateful for. "
1,"I can tell you to ""Always look on the Bright side of Life"" until I am blue in the face.
How you personally look at the world is not just as simple as you choosing to view the Glass as half full all the time. It takes years of exposure to life with all of its experiences to get you to the world view you currently have right now . . . The idea of simply waking up with a contradictory view one day is just not going to happen. Even with medications bringing up your dopamine and serotonin levels . . . It takes time. . . . A very long time with small changes to even get close.
Start with little goals that you can easily attain and work towards mid-term goals  . . . Then maybe long term goals.
Who told you that you were a negative thinker?"

1,"As a licensed electrician, I have noticed a few weaknesses of electrical engineers (EEs). EE's are not required to attend update classes, or any other training to keep up with code changes and equipment updates.
EE's design home, commercial and secondary distribution systems, but they do not pull permits, which a licensed electrician does.
By Michigan Law, a licensed electrician is the only one who pulls permits, installs electrical devices and can accept the work. EE's that are not up to date pull shortcuts, and do not follow the electrical codes, which make the electrician's life difficult and make jobs cost more."
1,"EE's are very BOOK focused, and if it's new or not in his books it's wrong!
They tend to be very bigoted and unable to walk on new or virgin ground! Are so book smart that they forget the sun was once TAUGHT it went around the earth, and 98% are this way, too!

However this is not the only group with this ""God Like"" attitude for it is common all Phd's and others, too.

This is the very reason ""The Durants"" came up with that question about the tree I posted. For the farther down the tree you see the better you would would be in research, where the books help but do not rule.

The best I've seen on that question (other than my partner and I) saw the trunk of the tree!

For a true analytical mind or one with a very high degree of logic and reasoning is very uncommon and most say it's very rare.

Answer that question honestly and be honest, or your cheating yourself only.
However that was given to me by Charles Durant, and even though I'm not positive, I believe that question originally came from his grandfather ""The World Renowned"" and ""Award Winning"" ""Will Durant"" He died in 1882!

Also check out the difference between Apple and IBM, for that was logic and reasoning in it's purest form!"

1,"A private education can have many advantages.
Private education offers the chance for a child to grow in terms of personal development and confidence.
Many private schools are highly academic and are ideal for a motivated, academic student. However many private schools are less academically focused and aim to provide a good all round education for children on a variety of levels rather than being purely academic.
State schools are not always in good catchment areas and private education can ensure that the majority of the classes are full of motivated pupils in many cases.
Personal development is highly valued and children get more individual attention in the private sector.
The downside is that students at private schools do not mix with a wide mixture of other children from different backgrounds and may have a narrower perspective on a range of social issues. Conversely some may argue that this is a positive in favour of the private sector.
One disadvantage which is a major one is cost. Many parents and children are at a disadvantage because of the cost of fees which are usually very high - the present Labour Government withdrew assisted place funding which benefited many gifted children.
There are some scholarships and bursaries available but the competition for them is high."
1,Advantages And Disadvantages Of A Private Education
1,Disadvantages of private schools in Nigeria
1,"Positives:
Small class sizes.
Impressive test scores (not always, though).
A wider variety of extra-curricular on-site opportunities (not always)
A smaller tightly knit school community.
Not necessarily tied to the National Curriculum (some independent schools follow it, anyway).
Not required to sit SATs.

Negatives:
High cost (for most a consideration!).

""Keeping up with the Jones'"": if your child's classmates are wealthy and manifest that wealth, will your child feel left out if your family doesn't have as much money?

Many private schools do not require their teachers to have the same level of achievement or accreditation as is required in the state sector.

Cultural or social isolation: your child will probably a larger range of other types of people in a state school.

Being tapped for money: if you thought the state sector schools are always fund-raising, that's not a patch on the work that private schools have to do to get extra money in.

Can be bad or good
Hot-housing: not an issue everywhere, but do you want your child in an environment with high academic expectations? What if that's not what they're like?

Formality (independents are usually more formally run)."

1,Private eduction is good than public education because private education provide wide range of knowlede to students but downside private education is cause for discrimination between children

0,"If your aim is to improve your aptitude and knowledge base in a particular field, all education pertaining to this subject will useful. If this statement is assumed true, then the benefits afforded by private tuition are enormous. You will have the advantage of a whole teacher to yourself, with their lesson plans and strategies of teaching designed just for you! It seems impossible to doubt the enormous benefits this will offer. In a classroom, one teacher may be faced with around thirty pupils, each with different abilities, different rates of learning, and individual strengths and weaknesses; yet despite this, for the majority of the lesson the teacher will be forced to treat his class as if it contained just one student. He or she will orate from one end of the classroom, unable to gauge how effectively each pupil is assimilating the lesson. The lesson plans will be designed to fit the needs of the average pupil; and the teacher will proceed at a rate suitable for the average pupil.
In this environment it is all to easy for a bright child or adolescent to fail to grasp one particular point, as the swathe of teacher talk washes over them like the unrelenting tides. It is unlikely even the best of teachers would spot the particular point of misunderstanding cast on the countenance on one pupil, hidden amongst so many other faces. To draw attention to their lack of understanding can be intimidating for the pupil: Everyone else is silent, so they must have understood. Do I want to draw attention to myself? All too often the misunderstanding goes unexpressed and unaided. The obvious benefit of one to one tuition is that the tutor can tailor their teaching style to the abilities of their student. They will be able to gauge the level of the pupils understanding, and, more importantly, track down the sources of misunderstanding, and deal with them effectively. Away from the bustle of the classroom, the student will feel more able to voice their difficulties; and having just one pupil to deal with, the teacher will be more capable of resolving them.
Compared to the conflicts of the classroom, fraught with distractions and intimidations from other pupils, the relaxed environment of tutor and student can be a safe haven of erudition. Most tutors will be willing to travel to the pupil's house, allowing them the benefit of learning in a happy home location.A tutor will be able to focus their teaching on a particular area: The pupil may be very competent in mathematics overall, but be deficient in calculus, with this specific weakness undermining their whole confidence in the subject. Maybe they are highly literate and proficient in English language, but shy away from public speaking. The syllabus may demand some oral work (foreign languages certainly do), so it would be a shame if this particular and minor deficiency detracted from their overall grade in the subject. Even if the pupil is performing well at school or college, it is highly likely that some private tuition will give then the edge over their peers. For it is their friends and contemporaries that they are competing against - many of whomay already be receiving tuition. In an age where extra tuition is almost becoming the norm, it may be necessary to join in, or risk being left behind. "

Social justice takes a back seat. Private education mainly serves the interests of the apathetic middle class and the elite.

It uses laser to track the movements and is much more accurate over bumpy surfaces than your standard ball or optical mouse."

You will simply be required to plug the bud into one of the USB ports of your device and you can then use the mouse without having to worry about getting tangled.

1,"Source Data Automation is the use of automated methods of data entry that attempt to reduce or eliminate many of the activities, people and data media required by traditional data entry methods. It is basically the process of collecting data at the point of origin in digital form.

Automated data entry eliminates much of the effort and delay in the extra handling involved in traditional data entry methods and therefore the potential for error in duplicated entries etc.. The data can then be collected straight from the Source Data Automation device, which is ready to process the transaction and it is possible to instantly check for accuracy during the data entry process.

Its many benefits have made source data automation a compelling choice for many types of commercial data entry today. Source data automation has transformed a number of information handling tasks. For example, workers who take orders over the phone today usually enter needed input directly into a display workstation, so they don't have to record the same data twice.

Source data automation also speeds up checkout lines and inventory taking at supermarkets, quality control operations in factories and check processing in banks. Examples of source data automation include bar code scanners, (otherwise known as Optical Character Readers), Magnetic Ink Character Recognition (MICR codes) on bank checks, the magnetic stripe on credit cards, touch screens and voice recognition systems. Source Data Automation is used because of its cost effectiveness; it contains accurate and complete data and provides quick  availability of data. It is also easy to track operational trends and can support decisions."

You were actually expected to know and articulate the significance of specific historical events.  You not only did more writing, but you did it by hand with a pen and paper, and you were expected to actually conform to standard rules governing spelling, punctuation, grammar, etc, or you would fail... Oh and that is in Latin as well as English.  Being able to read, write, and speak foreign languages was one of the benchmarks of an educated individual.

1,"The major advantages of public school education are as follows :-

1) Your child is exposed to the maximum number of people which helps them learn to get along with people from different background. This also leads to a greater synergy in terms of diversity as each group bring their own set of unique experiences.

2) Public schools generally follow a standardized curriculum and is calibrated ubiquitously through out the country

3) Public schools are free.

4) Public schools are generally secular in charter as they do not expose the children to religious studies.

The disadvantages of Public schools however are :-

1) There's generally more reported acts of violence in public schools.

2) Individual attention is very rare since they sport bigger classroom with greater number of pupils."

1,"Women love to wear jewelry for a variety of reasons and many will not leave the house without having some jewelry on. Jewelry to many women is a form of statement. It expresses what they like and also can be a great visual indicator to a person's wealth.

Many woman will spend a considerable sum of money on jewelry as they believe it will show just how wealthy they are. However it is not always simple to define if the person's jewelry is really that expensive. Over the past few years more and more 'imitation' jewelery pieces have flooded the market from the Far East. If you look on auction sites such as eBay.com you can see there are rings, necklaces and earrings that look almost identical to ones that cost $5,000 but are actually on sale for around $10.

Women love to wear jewelry that is sentimental to them. It may be due to the piece of jewelry being bought by a loved one or they may have bought it from a special place such as on holiday and so it is a great memory of this particular time. Some woman also believe jewellery can have a very powerful spiritual meaning and so will wear particular necklaces that represent things such as luck or love.

Religion is also a major part of why some women wear jewelry. The crucifix is one of the most popular pieces of jewelry in the world and works as a clear way of declaring their religion."

1,We all know that women want to look stylish and beautiful. Jewelry is something that augments the wearer's look tremendously. That's why women love jewelry.
1,"Jewellery is of course a sign of one’s status. Wearing a piece of jewellery that looks expensive is definitely a way to show that one is wealthy. In these cases, the designs of the jewellery or the materials used are usually more important than making a fashion statement.
I wear jewellery because I love it very much. Some women also wear to impress or to show others. Last month I had bought some amber stones from ""Drfinejewels"" and use these for making a bracelet. Really this looks beautiful and attractive."
1,"There are so vain, they would wear anything if they think it makes them look good."
1,"Everywhere in the world, women are wearing an ample variety of jewelry. Whether it is about necklaces, bracelets or earrings, jewelry is extremely popular.
The fact is that jewelry has always been an important part of human cultures, serving several purposes that are deeply significant to each of us.
The great importance of jewelry in women’s life may be explained by the fact that women love jewelry since ages, so it’s something they have inherited…it’s like without jewelry there’s something major missing.
Jewelry is an important ornament for all special occasions a woman goes through in life - like wedding, anniversary, birthday party, the birth of the first child (in some places women receive jewelry from their husband to mark the special event). So, if women didn’t wear jewelry on such special occasions, it would be at least odd, don’t you agree? Jewelry gives women a gorgeous, feminine look and brings out a more confidence, style and beauty.
Jewelry is also one of the best and expensive gifts that a husband can offer to his wife. There is great variety of different jewelry a man can choose from, and it all very much depends on the event he wants to present himself with the gift and on the style he wants to go for and of course the amount of money he is willing to pay; jewelry can be made from expensive as well as from cheap materials, so it’s really up to you.
Jewelry however is not only served for decoration, as it also represents the best investment one can make in his/her life; it serves as best safety in time of emergency as well.

Traditionally, jewelry represents a symbol of prestige, wealth and power. Jewelry has the ability to highlight women’s personality and bring out the best features when wearing the right jewelry for the right occasion.

So, jewelry has a great importance in women’s life because it can make a woman feel special, stylish and beautiful.

1,"ANONYMOUS.........THE SYMPTOMS OF TEEN DEPRESSION CAN APPEAR DURING ADOLESCENCE.
WHAT PARENTS CAN DO; 
Recognize that depressed teens may find it hard to express their feelings or may not understand what is happening to them. They may not even be aware of the symptoms of depression.
Teens tend to express their depression in ways different from those of adults, so be alert to major changes in your child’s behavior, eating habits, moods, sleep patterns, or social interactions—especially if the changes persist for weeks.
Take seriously any comments or hints regarding suicide.
If you suspect depression (not just the blues), consider getting a professional diagnosis.
Help your teen adhere to the doctor’s prescribed treatment, and consult the doctor if you see no improvement or observe unpleasant side effects.
Have a stable family routine for eating, exercising, and sleeping.
Maintain good communication with your teen, and help him or her to deal with any stigma associated with depression.
Because depression can make one feel alone, ashamed, or worthless, regularly reassure your teen of your love."

1) Your child is exposed to the maximum number of people which helps them learn to get along with people from different background. This also leads to a greater synergy in terms of diversity as each group bring their own set of unique experiences.

2) Public schools generally follow a standardized curriculum and is calibrated ubiquitously through out the country

3) Public schools are free.

4) Public schools are generally secular in charter as they do not expose the children to religious studies.

The disadvantages of Public schools however are :-

1) There's generally more reported acts of violence in public schools.

2) Individual attention is very rare since they sport bigger classroom with greater number of pupils."

0,"I usually don't respond to these questions but Ill let this time be an occasion.

Despite how convenient it may sound, losing weight ""quickly"" would probably not feel as rewarding for long. More like a short lived impulse that after it happens, turns into a down feeling. If you take the process duration and plan it you will feel happier once you accomplish it. Knowing your planned determination was a result of doing properly (long route) it also builds a sense of control once the results progress.
A lot of people have told me they felt that ""now what"" feeling after quickly rushing off their weight goals like you're talking about. I think if you want to, you can lose 20 pounds. But can you find a way to urgently cheat through it..? Probably not. Im sure its possible though. Maybe you could.
Just don't accept any easy routes as truth. Most of stuff you'll hear online will be lies and unsafe and the other 20% scams. Id say 80% of the methods you will hear online are false.
I have heard a lot of them myself and I have not once tried to lose weight myself! That, Ironically, is why Im warning you. Because with all the bs I have seen then I could only imagine what someone searching for intentionally will find.

Im sure everyone does not agree with me, but this is my advice. Besides of course the ""ask your doctor"" thought response."

1,Talk to a doctor!! Please don't do anything dangerous!!!
0,Oh my !  Ho did this person gain 20 pounds so quickly?
1,"You didn't gain it quickly, so don't expect to lose it quickly.  The proper way is to eat a well balanced, well portioned diet. Stay hydrated and get at least 8 hours of sleep.  Also get 30 minutes of exercise everyday. Just walk. It is free and easy to do. If you don't have 30 minutes at one time, do two 15 minute walks or three 10 minute walks."
1,"Create a Calorie deficit.
Figure out what you are consuming daily and reduce it by 200 to 300 calories if you are maintaining weight, and not gaining weight.
Add in at least 10,000 steps a day and you will lose weight. Since you didn't gain it overnight, do not expect to lose it overnight.   "
1,"I believe you should focus more on eating healthy and getting proper nutrition than simply losing weight. You will lose weight along the way, which is good, but to strive to eat healthy for the sake of it is more of a lifestyle than a goal. If you tried to just lose weight, then it is likely you will gain it back once you've lost if your goal is a particular destination rather than an overall health habit change. Also, just because you're eating enough to lose doesn't necessarily equate to eating good.
Additionally, it is important to know that even though items may have the same about of calories in them, doesn't mean that they're equally as fattening contrary to popular belief. You actually burn foods like almonds faster than crackers even if you intake the same amount of calories of either.
Also, stay clear of ""diet"" foods. Special ""K"" chips, fat free cookies, etc. They're actually worse for you, and in order to make them ""fat free"" or ""sugar free"" they either have to load in tons of sugar or artificial sweetener, which is the real devil here. Eat some real food and not factory-crap advertised as good for diets.
(Added) Sugar is the biggest perpetrator in obesity. It does not carry nutrients or anything humans need in it, but it is very fattening, addicting, and causes cravings and hunger. In fact, sugar is more addicting than heroin, which can perhaps paint a picture on the extent sugar is what causes cravings and misleading hunger signals, making it detrimental to our health. So try to limit sugar, yet don't get sweets and junk food that is labeled ""sugar free."" They contain artificial sweeteners, which is worse for you even though they don't taste nearly as good."
1,"In order to lose wait follow these steps:
Consult with a medical professional
Determine if you actually need to lose weight, and if so, how much
Make sure you’re doing it for the right reasons
Be realistic about losing weight fast
Make your health your priority
Limit restaurant meals
Get plenty of exercises
Drink a lot of water
Stop drinking your calories
Avoid fad diets"
0,"Okay so you neek a pocket knife and a big paper clip.

You bend the paper clip so that there is a straight part on it. You stick that into the top of the lock. If you look you will see little like shelves sort of and you have to make sure all of those are pressed up.Then you take the pocket knife and turn the lock."
1,"If the movies are to be believed, all you need is a hair pin which you insert into the lock and then jiggle around for five seconds or so. The, hey presto, the door swings open and you enter with a big grin on your face.

Unfortunately, it's slightly more complicated than that. Indeed, most burglars tend to use brute force rather dexterity to gain entry. More crude battering ram than hair pin, to be honest.

The only people that can successfully pick any kind of secure lock is a locksmith and he will need something called a skeleton key to do so. Or rather a whole bunch of skeletons keys until the lock opens.

In any case, most modern locks are not designed to be easily picked. Not like the days of old when there were certain cars that would start with the key off a corned beef tin."
0,"I happened to stumble across this response and just could not resist the opportunity to reply.

I am sorry, but your answer lacks any insight or basic knowledge regarding lock smithing. I guess you have never witnessed a lock smith manipulating a secured lock in lieu of a key. You might be surprised to learn that a lock smith can actually ""pick"" the lock using a ""lock pick"". However, you do not necessarily need to be a lock smith to ""pick"" a lock. With a lot of patience and considerable practice, anyone can learn to pick a lock without the formal training received by the lock smith.

In some cases, the associated tools of the trade may not be required. For instance, given the scenario, the only tool that may be needed is a credit card. Using a credit card, however, to compress the locking mechanism would not technically be considered ""picking the lock"" but rather deemed ""breaking and entering""."
1,"You can pick a lock from locksmith firm. For this you just need to look for a locksmith company online and see the feedback they have got. You can even simply search for ""locksmith in San Francisco""."

1,"Lock picking is defined as the manipulation of a lock's components to open the lock without a normal key. Therefore to pick a lock successfully one must understand the principles of both lock and key. A standard deadbolt lock consists of pins tumblers that are rotated by the key to open the lock. Most locks are similar in concept so learning this method of lock picking will serve you well. 

Buy a practice lock. Get a standard five-pin deadbolt lock that can be disassembled. 
Remove all but the first pin closest to the front of the lock.
The way to pick a door lock is by maneuvering the pin tumblers to the sheer line. The sheer line is a mechanism of measurement that tells the lock it is okay to open. As a key lifts the first pin it tumbles into its sheer line groove, the key is already entering the gap of the second pin, and so on.
Fashion the pick tool. Pick tools can be made from a straightened paperclip, the flat end of a hairpin, or a tiny flathead screwdriver. They can also be fashioned out of straight or safety pins, or an industrial staple.
Turn the lock upside down and watch as gravity pulls the pin down. This shows where to insert the pick and apply gentle pressure downward. When you hit the sheer line, the plug will turn and the student will know the feel and pressure needed to release a pin. Turn the lock right side up and practice.
Once the one pin has been mastered, add another pin back into the lock. Close the lock and try again. If the first pin is not released, the second pin cannot be engaged. Keep practicing and adding pins until all five are back in the lock.
With concentrated focus on the lock picking, mastery of this technique can take as little as an hour.  The more pins that a lock has, the sturdier the pick will need to be.

One never knows where and when a lock will need to be picked.  However, mastering the art of lock picking may get an individual back into their own car or home without incurring the expense of calling a locksmith."

1,The BEST way is to use a key
0,No no no the best way its to cut it off or my Fave use a shot gun!!! BAM! But note you will not see the lock anymore...
0,Just Buy a pocket knife and get a paper clip put the paper on the top part of the lock and the pocket knife in the bottom part
1,"""Multiverse"" is correct ... As ""universe"" means there is only one, so there can't be parallel universes.  There can be parallel multiverses, but that is redundant phrasing.  Unless there are intersecting multiverses."
0,"Not really a simple answer for this one.
These quotes come from the physic stack exchange and from
www.dummies.com/education/science/physics/string-theory-para
In string theory, the multiverse is a theory in which our universe is not the only one; many universes exist parallel to each other. These distinct universes within the multiverse theory are called parallel universes.
“Parallel universes “ is a description of the many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics."

1,"Girls and shopping go together like beer and pretzels. No-one fully understand why it works, but it just does. Read on to get some more insight into this perplexing phenomenon.

Women and shopping: Why girls love to shop.

The desire to own nice things isn't unique to women. Throughout history, men have been just as obsessed by their possessions, if not more so.

In my opinion, it's the idea of options and choice that women enjoy. They enjoy picking out and matching outfits, they are enticed by the brands and the images these brands portray.

In a sense, shopping is a lot like hunting. Women spend hours stalking around shops observing and comparing, building up to that moment when they finally decide to go for the kill (and max your credit card out) in one fell swoop.

Why women are hooked on shopping?


My view on the shopping 'pandemic' is that women are actually the victims in this cycle. In these days of consumerism, we are constantly bombarded with opportunities to shop. From shopping channels like QVC to the 'retail experience' that department stores offer, shopping has become more than the simple act of acquiring goods in exchange for money.

From Denver to Dubai, the world is full of extravagant shopping malls and major retailers that have become household names."
1,"In this modern world of fashion, style has become a statement. Today for every girl to look presentable has become an important factor. And so shopping for cosmetics, clothes, bags, sandals, shoes, etc has become a daily routine.

Girls generally prefer variety in their clothing. They need to have new collection practically every week. And so shopping on a weekend has become a part of daily life.

Being well-dressed and looking good is very important. Every girl wants to look better than the other. Some of the factors that are looked for are combination of colors, the types of sandal or shoes for clothing accessories etc.

However, for those who are not fashion freaks, there are other things for example scented candles, hosiery stuff, etc to shop for."
0,"I think everyone loves shopping, not only girls."
1,It has always been that way. Girls get very excited to shop. Just like boys like sports.
0,"Males love shopping too, always have to look sharp. Except they tend to be more private about it and go shopping alone discretely. Or just order online."
0,"What kind of sexist moron wrote that?

Are you saying that ""girls"" who don't go shopping every day for cosmetics are not presentable? Maybe because they are too busy using their brains instead, eh?!"
1,"The Girls or women like shopping very much rather than other things because they want to show off their desires and status. You may belive or not,  to get the matching things whether they are clothing or footwear or anything, they may visit around all shopping stores to check. Even they don't bother about the money or time in their searching. If the matched one or desired one has been found, that must be purchased irrespective of its price. Even they moslty like to shop clothing, footwear, jewelry and also spend more time for choosing them."
0,"Shopping can sometimes be therapeutic for girls. In the same way as
video games or fishing can be for some men. Shopping can take your mind
off of boy problems or school or work issues. You get to take your mind
off of problems and focus on buying a little present or presents for
yourself. Many girls like to look pretty and dress to impress and you
can't do that unless you go shopping. At the end of the day you get atl
east one good item that will brighten your day(s). Shopping can also be a
way to bond with your friends. Research shows that 'cave women' would
gather food, like shopping for them. During this time, women would talk
and bond. Perhaps this has be carried on through the generations and is
now in the form of shopping. Sometime, women talk about their problems
to others while looking at earrings, again, being therapeutic. And who
doesn't like a new dress, it's another type of clothing you can look
good in!         "

0,"You see it in every shopping mall: Men sitting outside the clothing store waiting for the wife to come out. Why is it that women love to try on every pair of shoes before deciding whether to buy anything at all, and men want to get out of the mall seconds after they get in?
It's all in the genes, according to Daniel Kruger, an evolutionary psychologist at the University of Michigan. Kruger argues that it's natural for women to love to shop and men to hate it because of our evolutionary past.
Men were the hunters in our ancestral cultures, so when they find a satisfactory specimen, whether it's an elk or a pair of shoes, they want to shoot it and get out before it gets away.
Women, by contrast, were the primary gatherers in early hunter-gatherer cultures, so they feel a need to check every berry on the bush to make sure they're getting the best deal."

I'm a Naturopath and a best-selling Amazon author who has helped over 14,793 women and men reclaim their health, fitness, and happiness with the advice they needed to improve their physical well-being.
As a professional weight-loss expert, I was ashamed and frustrated by the weight I'd gained after a difficult and complicated pregnancy. No matter which of my time-tested techniques I tried, I just couldn't get rid of pounds and pounds of stubborn excess fat!
It was like I was a stranger in my own body, trapped in a shell I didn't even recognize anymore. The worst part was that I couldn't seem to do anything to get my life back to normal.
I was disappointed, ashamed, and more alone than I'd ever been. I felt absolutely helpless.
That all changed when I took a plane to Africa and discovered the delicious tea that made me burn body fat quickly and easily, without feeling hungry.

0,"In a world where weight loss is highly discussed and so are the different issues that are accompanied by obesity and excessive weight gain, a very important topic of weight gain is skipped. Weight gain is a very serious issue, just like weight loss is. However, a person who needs help with it, hesitates and is shy in discussing the problem mainly because people think that weight gain is not so important. Obviously, who would want to gain weight? This is because people focus on how they should look on the outside. This has become a status symbol of beauty and people do not realize how and what an underweight person has to go through especially in the matter of health. There are numerous health issues that such a person has to face and many of those have been mentioned below.
In order to modify your body to its ideal condition, you have to follow a lot of processes. Weight gain is a very slow and difficult process just like weight loss is. Basically, an underweight person lacks all the essential things that his or her body needs. All the essential vitamins, nutrients and the goodness of foods that the person needs to lead a happy and healthy life, are missing from their bodies. Hence, they face numerous different diseases and in short, illnesses are the outcome. So the importance of knowing and maintaining the healthy weight range cannot be neglected. To check your health conditions regularly use health calculators.
The purpose of a person, must not be to become stick thin and look extremely thin, they must consider health in all of this because only a healthy body can make it through the end. And that can be done only if one has the right figure of weight. So before starting up the process, one must estimate and calculate what their healthy weight range is as it varies not just with age but also with height and gender and therefore, it is different from different people. So knowing your healthy weight and then working for the balance of your weight is a much more sensible and practical approach rather than doing things without any awareness.
ILLNESSES OR HEALTH ISSUES THAT AN UNDERWEIGHT PERSON HAS TO FACE:
There are a number of different health issues that an underweight person has to go through. This might come to you as a shocker. Basically, an underweight person has a lot of deficiencies due to a poor diet. So, all the different diseases that they have to face, basically concern the deficiencies or are due to them. Some of these are listed below.

Also, fish contains a high content of proteins and carbs and yes, all the healthy fatty acids as mentioned above.

So all the extra benefits with weight gain, what else do you need?

3- Dry fruits.
Oh and let's not skip how dry fruits can help. Dry fruits are saturated with sugar and hence they are not helpful when it comes to the purpose of weight loss. But definitely for weight gain. Dry fruits make a yummy treat for the purpose and provide you with a lot of minerals and good fatty acids.

4- Wholegrain and oats.
If you need a synonym of carbohydrates, then you have oats and wholegrain. These are a home to carbohydrate. They can help you gain weight in a very healthy manner. However, one must avoid processed food and go for the natural ones because artificial things do not have any goodness in them.
5- Cheese.
Coming to dairy products, you can use this yummy treat in so many different ways. Either slice your cheese and use it in your sandwich or either shred it and add taste to your boring meals. Or if you don’t like the idea, then melt it and eat it with your pasta or go for baked pasta. Cheese is known to be fattening and will help you gain weight in no time.
6- Milk.
Okay, did your grandmother ever tell you about how important a glass of milk before bed was? Well, she was kind of right. Milk provides you with calcium, proteins and etc. It helps in making your bones stronger. You can go for milkshakes for extra goodness. Chocolate milkshakes banana milkshakes and etc. All are very helpful.
Milk also has lactic acid in it.

13- Supplements.
Protein supplements, like whey proteins, are the best friends of bodybuilders and muscle gainers. Supplements can help you get what you need. However, all that you get in the form of supplements can be acquired naturally. You get the protein shakes in the form of powders and you can further make a shake with the help of this powder. However, the supplements are usually expensive especially if you are looking for the good quality ones and it is better to get the benefits naturally in the form of food if you are not willing to spend money on them.
14- Rice.
Rice is also very helpful. Being rich in carbohydrates, rice is known to provide you with about more than 180 calories on 43 grams.

Meat makes you feel filled and you cannot just for the purpose of weight gain without including meat and specifically red meat into your diet.
16- Leafy green vegetables.
The leafy green vegetables, like spinach and etc. Are a rich source of fiber to the body. Spinach is known to provide your body with energy and usually, the underweight bodies lack the energy. Therefore, vegetables like spinach, are very helpful to them.

You can use your peanut butter on your whole nut bread and make it look delicious as well as super healthy for yourself. Peanut butter has a high protein content in it. Or you can even make your own peanut butter biscuits or cookies.
18- Ice cream.
Now let’s first get to the ingredients present in the ice cream. Ice cream is basically made out of milk. In addition to milk, is saturated with a high quantity of sugar. Coming towards the flavors, it can be fruit flavored, chocolate flavored and countless other ones which increase its goodness and multiply it by many times. Ice cream can just make the process a lot more fun and delicious and you will develop an interest in eating.

1,"Try keto diet
The ketogenic diet puts your body into a state of ketosis, which ultimately allows you to use fat for energy.
Fat burning is just one of the many benefits of ketosis that improves overall health and makes it an effective tool for weight loss.
Keto has a cult following for a good reason: It makes you feel great. Keto-ers feel more satiated throughout the day and have increased energy levels, both physical and mental, leading to:
Fewer cravings
Lower caloric intake
More self-control
More physical activity.
These benefits all contribute to weight loss; however, keto is not synonymous with weight loss.
Far from being a magic tool, the ketogenic diet takes accurate and diligent tracking and adjustment to work. You need a balance of the right macros, realistic goal setting and tracking to take you closer to achieving your weight loss goals.
In this guide, we’ll cover the following:

How to Adjust to Induce KetosisReview Your Goals and Results
By the end of this guide, you’ll have everything you need to get started on the ketogenic diet to lose weight the right way — for the long term.
Ketosis is a metabolic state in which your body uses fat rather than glucose from carbohydrates as its primary source of energy.
To achieve ketosis, you stop supplying your body with carbs and sugar. This depletes your stored glucose — also known as glycogen — and your blood sugar and insulin levels decrease. Your body starts to look for an alternate source of fuel (fat), releases it and burns it for energy.
Hence, weight loss on keto.
Because of the decrease of glucose and increase in the metabolism of fat, ketosis has a ton of benefits — its unique ability to induce weight loss is just one of them. Many people use ketosis as a treatment for epilepsy, diabetes and even cancer.
When your body burns fat, it produces ketones. Without ketones, you’re not in ketosis.  Therefore, the ketogenic diet’s sole purpose is to aid and promote ketone production.
WHAT ARE KETONES?
Ketones are the metabolic fuel produced when your body shifts into fat-burning mode.
Glucose and ketones are the only energy sources used by the brain. Think of ketones as the auxiliary power source of your body.
Before the advent of agriculture, when our ancestors were hunter-gatherers, they fasted regularly. When food was scarce, they didn’t have a choice but to wait for an opportune time to hunt for food and cook it.
They had a very low intake of carbs and protein and thus were unintentionally running on ketones. Converting stored fat into energy is hardwired for our survival and a natural part of human existence.
Your body burns fat to use and produce ketones whenever glucose sources are low or depleted, such as:
during fasting
after prolonged exercise
when you eat a ketogenic diet.
Lipase (an enzyme responsible for fat breakdown) releases stored triglycerides (fats). These fatty acids go to your liver and your liver turns them into ketones. 
There are three types of ketone bodies:
Acetoacetate – During the breakdown of long- and medium-chain fatty acids for energy, acetoacetate is produced first.
Acetone – Spontaneously, acetone is also produced as a by-product of acetoacetate. Both of these ketone bodies, when not used, spill into your urine and breath, making urine and breath testing a promising measurement of whether or not you’re going into ketosis. More on this below in How to Test Ketone Levels.
Beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) – Not technically a ketone but a molecule. Its essential role in the ketogenic diet makes it count as the important ketone body. BHB is synthesized by your liver from acetoacetate. BHB is important because it can freely float throughout your body in your blood, crossing many tissues where other molecules can’t. It enters the mitochondria and gets turned into ATP (adenosine triphosphate), the energy currency of your cells. BHB = ATP = energy!
Now that you know what ketones are and how ketosis works, you probably want to know why you should consider eating a ketogenic diet — the diet that promotes ketosis.
The Benefits of Ketosis
The benefits of ketones come from your body burning fat for fuel and the lowered glucose and insulin in your blood.
The benefits of ketosis include:
Body fat burning
Mental clarity and increased cognition
Improved physical energy
No feeling of deprivation because you experience less hunger[*]
Steady blood sugar levels from little to no intake of refined carbs
Skin improvements in those with acne[*]
Improved triglyceride and cholesterol levels[*]
Hormone regulation — women who go on keto report less severe symptoms of PMS[*].

BPO is a much broader term when compared to call centre. However, the two terms have a relationship. A call center is a sub-set or sub-unit of a BPO. It is a place where business is done over the telephone. Again there are BPOs where there are no call centres but the entire business is handled through the web. BPO includes, IT services, financial services etc.

A call centre can be seen as a centre for handling the business of internal and/or overseas clients and different companies can outsource parts of their business to call centres. A call centre is also considered as a BPO which handles business over the telephone. However, there is a misconception among many people that BPO means a call centre. This is incorrect."

1,"Business Process Outsourcing basically is the leveraging of expertise or specialist process vendors to offer and administer an organization's critical or non-critical enterprise developments and applications. The most well known examples of BPO are call centres, human resources, accounting and payroll outsourcing.

A call centre basically is a centralized office generally used for the function of receiving and transmitting a huge quantity of requests via telephone. A call centre usually is controlled by a company to manage received product support or information queries from customers.

Outbound calls for the purpose of telemarketing, clientèle and dept collection are also carried out at call centres. A call centre is normally operated via a widespread open workshop for call centre agents along with a work station which normally comprises of a computer for each agent."

In a call center the only form of work performed is making telephone calls and receiving telephone calls. Some calls are made to customers regarding late payments; to solicit money; to request a payment owned; to inform a customer of changes within the company and similar tasks. In one call center there may be employees making calls for several or many different companies depending upon the size of the call center.

The employees also accept calls, they are what is often referred to as first line employees, they accept the initial call, then as needed refer the call on to the appropriate person or company. For instance, if I have new stove and something goes wrong with it, I will call the company. However, the phone may not be answered at the same location, I purchased my stove. If, this company's calls go through a call center then, my call could be answered from anywhere. Once, I tell the person who I am and what I need, I will be connected to a service person either at the place, where I purchased my stove, or where ever the service department is located.

Call centers handle calls and make connections to other people to deal with the person and resolve any concerns. Not all business use call centers, but have telephone operators in the place business to accept and disburse calls.

Within each of these sections, not all workers are necessarily doing the same type of work, for the same company, who has outsourced their work to the BPO. One person may be cutting checks for company A and the next person my cutting checks for company B. It all depends upon the size of the BPO and how many companies have outsourced their work to them."
1,"The fundamental difference between a call center and a BPO is that a call center is be a BPO but a BPO may not be a call center. BPO is an abbreviation for Business Process Outsourcing. The process that is outsourced can be broadly classified into voice based and data based.

A call center is a voice based process. An example of a call center could be an insurance firm that chooses to sell insurance by cold calling potential clients. If it is based in the United States then the firm could choose to move the entire process to an Asian country. Agents will be hired in the Asian country and they will be trained.

As the cuts are significantly littler than their open partners, recuperation is speedier and post-agent torment is commonly less. Methods, for example, hernia repairs, gastric sidestep, gut resection, and organ expulsion are presently routinely done laparoscopically.

In any case, mind should be taken than organs don't get harmed and to this end the passage site may must be unique and another section procedure may must be utilized. The hazard to profit proportion of laparoscopic surgery is enhancing consistently for benefits.
Chronicled Perspective For Minimally Invasive Surgery
There is general accord among medicinal students of history that the primary believably recorded occurrences of endoscopy can be credited to the Arabian doctor Albukasim (936-1013 A.D). Seven more hundreds of years were to go before any further advancements in endoscopy. In 1805, doctor Phillip Bozzini utilized a lit up light chamber, a tube, and mirrors for appearance keeping in mind the end goal to investigate the human urethra. He could see the urinary bladder and to picture stones and neoplasms.

Georg Kelling of Dresden, in exhibit day Germany, first utilized laparoscopes to see the peritoneal cavities of live canines. Stockholm - conceived doctor Hans Christian Jakobaeus was the main individual to make utilization of a laparoscope on different human patients. He saw diverse pathologies and he depicted conditions, for example, cirrhosis of the liver, metastatic growth, and tuberculosis peritonitis.

The development of laparoscopy was subject to advancements in wellsprings of light that did not cause consumes and focal points that amplified and expanded the field of view. For instance, in 1929, the presentation of another focal point framework that allowed sideways (135°) seeing promoted laparoscopy in Europe. The appearance of the double trocar strategy at around a similar time gave a further fillip to analytic laparoscopy. The technique empowered specialists to both imagine the stomach cavity and at the same time to pass instruments into the pits.
Optics And Laparoscopy
Advances in photography, optics, lighting, and access to the stomach depression have characterized the improvement of present day laparoscopy as we probably am aware it today. The method of ""chilly light"" fiberglass brightening presented by a group of French researchers in 1952 enhanced wellbeing by dispensing with the danger of intraperitoneal consumes and electrical flaws that occurred when utilizing intra-stomach wellsprings of light. The ""icy light"" originated from an extraordinary proximal light source outside of the stomach depression along a quartz bar to the distal end of an endoscope and it was sufficiently serious to allow photos to be taken. German architect and gynecologist Kurt Semm is attributed with having contributed the greatest to improvements in interventional insignificantly obtrusive surgical strategy. A programmed insufflation gadget planned by Dr. Semm in 1977 empowered specialists to screen the two gas stream and intra-stomach weight.

Dr. Semm likewise created methods for hitch tying and created instruments that could execute the required moves. He promoted strategies, for example, laparoscopic lysis of omental attachments, entrail suturing, and tumor biopsy and arranging. In 1981, Dr. Semm played out the main laparoscopic appendectomy.
How Have Visual Tubes Evolved?
Laparoscopic visual instruments have developed from endoscopy of which there is archived prove that it was utilized as far back as 1806 to inspect the channels and pits of the human body. The primary endeavor at laparoscopic examination of the peritoneal cavity was completed in 1901 and the strategy was named ""Celioscopy.""

Laparoscopic methods kept on creating and by 1930s, specialists were performing analytic biopsies of stomach organs under direct representation. The seventies saw laparoscopic methods being normally utilized by gynecologists. In any case, its spread when all is said in done surgical practice was constrained in light of the fact that it didn't encourage complex surgical strategies due to the restricted field of view and the way that the specialist's hands were possessed in holding the laparoscope.

Accordingly, the year 1986 imprints a watershed occasion in the advancement of laparoscopic surgery since it was in this year that the video PC chip was produced. This improvement empowered specialists to extend amplified pictures onto TV screens and it made ready for more current and more intricate utilizations of laparoscopy. We can consider the year 1987 to be the year which genuinely proclaimed the entry of laparoscopic surgery. This is on the grounds that it was in this year that the primary laparoscopic cholecystectomy or gallbladder expulsion was first performed.
Surgical Dogma And Laparoscopy
However by and large specialists were reluctant to acknowledge laparoscopy as a really helpful type of surgery that required further examination and support. The purposes behind this are not clear but rather not having an unmistakable field of vision amid laparoscopy and surgical creed that had existed for quite a long time are a portion of the reasons that backed off the acknowledgment of this surgical system."

Each incision is referred to as a “port.”  At every port a tubular instrument known as a trochar is inserted.  Specialized devices and a unique digital camera known as a laparoscope are surpassed via the trochars for the duration of the method. At the start of the process, the stomach is inflated with carbon dioxide fuel to offer a operating and viewing space for the healthcare professional. The laparoscope transmits pictures from the belly hollow space to high-decision video monitors within the operating room.

Washing hair actually can thickens hair because dirty, greasy hair lies flat and looks ‘gappy'. Therefore, in order to get the best effect, you can use shampoo to wash hair regularly and wash with warm water.
Note: Avoid using hot water, because hot water will easily dry out the curly hair weave.
Tip3: Styling hair with fingers

Tip4: Apply mousse products
The most effective styling products to thicken your hair is mousse, which can make your hair look natural and fuller. Besides, another effective styling product is spray, which can give the hair “ root lift”.

1,"Communication is key in the world today and there are more forms available than ever before. The most common forms of media used for communication are:

• Print media
This form of media encompasses newspapers, magazines and leaflets. Print media is one the most popular and successful ways of communicating facts to people. Newspapers are used to provide people with news of the events that are happening throughout the world, and are vital to some people receiving information. Magazines provide facts, normally on specialist subjects, and these are useful to people with specific interests. Leaflets are useful for communicating business products and ideas to a mass marketplace. This information is printed and advertises the products to the potential customers.

• Broadcast media
Broadcast media generally covers radio and television, and this is an instant form of media, as the events that are talked about can be more up to date than they are in the printed media. The news on television can be updated on a minute-by-minute basis and this is now the case with rolling 24-hour news channels in most countries, relaying news as it breaks to the general public.

• Social media
Social media is media that is sometimes overlooked. This form of media involves word of mouth and its increase in recent years is down to social networking sites such as Facebook, although this can also fall under the rubik of electronic media.

• Electronic media
This type of media is more common since the advent of the Internet. The Internet is as instant as broadcast media, and most newspapers and television channels now have their own Internet sites that enable them to update information as it happens. Social networking sites such as Facebook and Tagged can also fall into this type of media."
1,"Tv, internet, cable, phone, etc."
1,"There are a number of ways in which people can communicate using the internet. The most popular and the oldest is email. Other ways to communicate on the internet are by entering internet chat rooms, through social networking sites like Facebook and Tagged, and by MSN Messenger, which enables instant communication between people. People can also talk to each other with the aid of webcams, enabling the users to not only hear each other, but also to see each other while they are talking. Email is the oldest form of internet communication, having been launched in the 1960s. Initially the electronic mails could only be sent between users who were connected to the same computer and these were in the form of text files that were delivered to a mailbox. In 1971, the first proper electronic mail message was sent to a different computer that was on the same network. Ray Tomlinson, an engineer who had been working on file transfer protocol and ARPANET, which was established prior to the internet, did this. Emails can now include text but can also incorporate video, images and sounds, and other files and documents can be attached to them. When mails are delivered they are encoded for privacy and upon reaching their destination are decoded so that the recipient can access and read them. Messages pass through a large mail server, which incorporates two different servers. One of these servers is known as the SMTP server and handles the mail that is being sent. The other server handles incoming messages and is known as the POP3 server. Wireless technology is another way of communicating over the internet. There are many hand-held devices available that can connect to the internet and these can be used to interact in the same way as when the internet is wired. Over 200 million people now use mobile internet access worldwide."
1,"The ways to communicate through the internet are chatting and video conference. Through chatting you can easily stay connected with family abroad or even get to know new people. Chat clients such as MIRC and YAHOO give you the opportunity to talk to new people and make new friends from all over the world. You can even watch and hear the people you know by using MSN Messenger, Yahoo Messengers and other instant messengers. You can call their computers and talk to them for free and save a lot that you would otherwise have to spend on an international call. You can also email people who may not be online while you are and get emails from them in turn, which you can read later. You can even send email and text messages to people on their cellphones by using certain websites. So, there are plenty of ways to communicate to people by using the internet."
1,"The Internet provides various ways of communication depending on the need and availability of hardware/software. These include e-mail, phone, instant messaging or I'm, short message service or SMS, video conferencing and Web conferencing. All these can be seamlessly integrated into one package if needed.

The two most popular ways at present are the e-mail and instant messaging (I'm) Interestingly, the e-mail predates the Internet. In the early days, the e-mail was an important tool in creating the Internet.

Instant messaging is different from e-mail. I'm can happen in real time and most I'm providers also add a few more services along with I'm. These can include file sharing and video and voice chat."

1,"In my opinion, the best way to make money online is to run your own website selling either goods or monetizing a service.
This is a very wide spectrum, there are so many things you could sell or services you could offer, so it really comes down to the following:
What resources you have available to you
What skills you possess
What is there demand for in the market?
Where is their the least competition in the market?
When eBay first launched in 1995, there was very little competition and it was able to claim a powerful position in the online retailer and auction market.
Since then, it has managed to negotiate the challenges of the past few decades, and it is currently one of the most profitable digital enterprises on the internet.
While it is unlikely that you'll create the next eBay overnight, you can take the same concept and look out for areas that people are demanding goods or a service, but where that demand isn't being fulfilled yet.
It sounds difficult, but companies are doing it all the time through the internet, so if you want to make lots and lots of money, then this is truly the best approach!"

0,"There isn't really a best way to make money online. Your ""best"" way to make money online will most likely defer from what someone else see as the ""best"" way to make money online. You need to find what works for you, and what you like, and then stick with it.
Some methods you can try out:
Start a blog in a niche you have some knowledge of. Write high quality content (or outsource the writing work) and then monetize the blog with affiliate links, cpa links and an ad-serving network such as Google AdSense.
Start a niche-based Amazon affiliate store. You can list several products from Amazon on your affiliate store and get paid commission every time your site refers a sale.
Start an online career as a freelancer. Consider your skills and knowledge, and then decide on a freelance career you want to engage in - graphic designer, article writer, data entry worker, virtual assistant, etc. You can join several freelancing sites such as Guru and UpWork.
If you're from the USA you can also apply to get paid for filling out surveys. Unfortunately only USA citizens get access to the surveys that actually pays good money. If you're not from the USA, you could still try it out but you won't be able to earn as much.
Give list building a go. Write a short report on a topic in a niche you have knowledge of, and then create a landing page offering the report you've written in exchange for an email address. You can then set up a list with an autoresponder like Aweber or GetResponse and start building a list - once you've collected a couple of email addresses you can promote affiliate products to your list of subscribers.
These ideas can help you get started online. If you're interested in building a list, here's a tutorial that walks you through the steps to set up a 100% free list building system: http://theprofitblogger.xyz/turn-your-wordpress-website-into-a-free-list-building-machine/"

Think about doing some freelance work, there's various websites like freelancer and upwork that might help you there. Considering selling some stuff on ebay, it's a great way of clearing space and making money at the same time.
Finally, consider online gaming. Whether it's a bit of online poker, blackjack or slots at Mr Green or PlayOJO. It's one of the more common ways of making a fast buck! Hopefully this helps and you start making money online!"

Earning money is not easy. Graduates are these days being rejected almost everywhere today. With this, you might be able to figure out where our market stands today. Though you can make money online but it sure won’t come easy. Here are a few ways how you can do that:
YouTube: This is one of the easiest ways to earn a lot of money, though it might come after investing a lot of time. You have to work on your content and keep it good. It might take a year or two to get settled but once settled in there is no stopping. There is no upper limits of how much you can earn through this channel. Monetize your videos and you are good to go. Top YouTube artists are earning upwards of 2 million dollars in a year with just adsense. Sponsorship and other offers will also be coming your way, keep an eye on it. Also, if you have uploaded a video on YouTube no matter how long ago, you would be eligible to earn money on it if it attracts views.
Blog Writing: If video making is something that you don’t see yourself doing in the coming years, then this is your second best option. Writing a blog can be done for free or by investing money and starting your blog on a separate domain. The more you you write, the more you earn. Quality material attracts more views. Write on trending topics and you’ll see your blog views shooting up. Checkfor setting up a free blog.
Freelancing: This is another way and is useful if you are trying to earn money but don’t have time to invest. With this, you won’t be earning big but cheques start raking in from the beginning itself. In this you will be selling your work, just like you do on a job. The benefit of freelancing is that you can work from home and you do not have to report to someone until the deadline is over. Work quality matters a lot with this kind of job. If quality is good, professionals would be typing your name in the list of people they want the work to be done from.  is pretty popular for this kind of work.
Few other ways are Work from home websites, selling stuff online, PTC websites, becoming a problem solver, completing surveys but these are not very reliable. If you are really investing your time make sure it is benefiting your future."

1,"Most of the time people get disheartened when they hear that the online world of earning quick money is a fraud. This is not always the case as there are legitimate and true ways to earn money while working from your home on computer.

The first and foremost legitimate way to earn money is to get a job as a freelance writer. There are many web site services which offer free lance writing services like you may be asked to write a project, summaries, abstracts etc. There are also companies that offer the jobs of transcribers. If your listening skills are good and you understand other languages easily then the job of transcriber will be good for you.

Also another way of earning money is to promote as an affiliate on sites like click bank.com or pay dot com.com. These are few companies which offer affiliate services where you can market the products of their affiliates by promoting their products on different sites like your blogs etc.

Another legitimate way of earning money is to read paid emails. There are different web site like cash mail.com which offer this service where you get paid for every email you read which they sent to you."

If you are after something which offers more technical editing capabilities similar to that of, say, Adobe Photoshop on a ""regular"" computer, a program like Filterstorm may be more up your street. 
This app offers a whole range of editing capabilities, and even allows you to import photos in RAW format. It's not free, though.

There are three major groups covered by Search Engine Land’s Periodic Table Of SEO Success Factors:
On-the-page SEO
Off-the-page SEO
Violations
Within each group are subgroups, as each chapter of this SEO guide will explain. These subgroups contain one or more individual SEO factors with a specific weight or importance.
Violations, while a group unto themselves, are displayed under the group and subgroup to which they’re associated.
Those two-letter acronyms you see on the chart above? That’s our play on the periodic table of elements and the letter representations, or symbol, of each element. You may have had to remember that the symbol for gold was Au or that iron was Fe.
In the Periodic Table of SEO, we’ve tried to make it slightly more intuitive. The first letter of each “SEO element” comes from the subgroup that it’s in, and the second letter stands for the individual factor.
SEO factors work in combination
No single SEO factor will guarantee search engine rankings. Having a great HTML title won’t help if a page has low-quality content. Having many links won’t help if they are all low in quality. Having several positive factors can increase the odds of success, while the presence of negative factors can worsen those odds.
On-the-page success factors
On-the-page search ranking factors are those that are almost entirely within the publisher’s own control. What type of content do you publish? Are you providing important HTML clues that help search engines (and users) determine relevancy? How does your site architecture help or hinder search engines?
on page SEO tools for free, https://www.prepostseo.com.
Off-the-page success factors
Off-the-page ranking factors are those that publishers do not directly control. Search engines use these because they learned early on that relying on publisher-controlled signals alone didn’t always yield the best results. For instance, some publishers may try to make themselves seem more relevant than they are in reality.
With billions of web pages to sort through, looking only at “on-the-page” clues isn’t enough. More signals are needed to return the best pages for any particular search.
SEO violations & ranking penalties
Make no mistake — search engines want people to perform SEO because it can help improve their search results. Search engines provide help in the form of guidelines, blog posts, and videos to encourage specific SEO techniques.
However, there are some techniques that search engines deem “spam” or “black hat,” which could result in your pages receiving a ranking penalty, or worse, being banned from the search engines entirely.
Violations are general tactics meant to deceive or manipulate a search engine’s understanding of a site’s true relevancy and authority.
A weighting of search ranking factors
All the factors we show are weighted on a scale of 1 to 3, as shown in the top right corner of each factor, as well as reflected in the hue of that factor. A weighting of 3 is most important and is something you should pay special attention to because it has a bigger impact than other factors.
That doesn’t mean that factors weighted 2 or 1 aren’t important; they are. It’s just that they are of less importance, relatively speaking, in terms of the other factors on the chart. Violations are also weighted, but in negative numbers, with -3 being the worst and potentially most harmful to your SEO success.
The weighting is based on a combination of what search engines have said, surveys of the SEO community and our own expertise and experience in watching the space over time. We don’t expect them to be perfect. Not everyone will agree. Your mileage may vary. But we’re confident it is a useful general guide."

1,"SEO stands for search engine optimization. It is a technique by which we increase the quality and quantity of traffic organically.  It is used to elevate the position of a page within Google's organic rankings for a particular keyword.

Techniques of SEO:-
White hat SEO:
White hat Seo is a most common technique which is used by marketers to gain higher rankings in the search engine result pages. The White hat SEO is considered to be a very good approach because it completely follows search engine rules and policies and does not aim to breach the Google's algorithms.

The practices listed under the White Hat SEO techniques may be slow in giving results but the results-driven are much more lasting in their approach.

Black hat SEO:-
Black hat SEO includes the practices that aim at finding weaknesses and loopholes in the Google’s algorithms in order to rank higher in the search engine result pages. These practices are against the Google guidelines and  Google’s algorithms.

Black Hat SEO tactics can get your website banned from Google and other search engines. The traffic generated through these practices does not last nor are the rankings able to maintain their position on the search engine research pages.
Thus, the practices under the label Black hat SEO are considered to be Bed Practice.
Gray hat SEO:
Apart from a Black Hat SEO And White Hat SEO, there exists Gray Hat SEO as well that includes some part from both white and black hat SEO. The Gray Hat SEO mainly came into existence because of the pressure from the clients to receive results they have been paying for. The third party companies have an extra inclination towards these mixed practices forming the Gray Hat SEO.

Types of SEO:
On Page optimization:
As per MOZ: On-page SEO is the practice of optimizing individual web pages in order to rank higher and earn more relevant traffic in search engines.

1,"A compilation is a grouping of important narrative essays; for example, a compilation of narrative essays may be chosen for publication because they all relate to a specific topic, such as politics, literature (such as reviews or essays about famous books), or science.

• Types of compilations

Often, a subject (for example, George Orwell`s stunning and prescient fiction work, 1984) will be studied in depth through a series of narrative essays, and these narrative essays will be bound in book format and released for students or other interested parties to read and learn from. In other situations, a famous pundit or author, such as the witty and bombastic right-wing writer, P.J. O`Rourke, will compile a list of their best narrative essays and release them in book form.

• Some writers shine in this format

Certain writers really shine in the narrative essay format, and these authors may enjoy supplementing their regular fiction or non-fiction works with groupings of narrative essays. British author Martin Amis, who alternates between stinging political and cultural narratives and post-modern fiction novels, is another example of a seasoned pro that often chooses to publish compilations of narrative essays in lieu of short stories or full-length novels.

• Write your own

Anyone who enjoys writing can make their own compilation of narrative essays, simply by collecting a group of higher-quality essays and arranging them in a logical way. Actually, making your own compilation can be excellent way to chart your progress as a writer; after all, over time, people who spend a lot of time creating essays will notice that their writing becomes more polished and professional. While reading through narrative essays that are compiled chronologically, writers may get a sense of how their writing is progressing and what potential still remains for significant improvement.

Bookstores and libraries may features special sections devoted to compilations of narrative essays."
1,"Generally, narrative essays involve two main components: A story and
some analysis of that story. A narrative essay may be ""about"" a
particular issue, theme, or concept, but it uses a personal story to
illustrate that idea.  "
1,"The narrative essay should be making for the purpose of providing good explanation to the readers about the particular title. The academic writing help for making those papers are success. The essays, dissertation, reviews are available for students at online"
1,"Compilation in general means a thing, especially a book, record, or broadcast programme, that is put together by assembling previously separate items.  The narrative essays are the detailed essays based on the personal experiences. All the personal stories of the writer are shared in these types of essays. The purpose of writing these essays is to introduce your personality to others and to understand it properly by yourself. All of your shared stories of life are read by people they get to know about different aspects of your life. It is not an easy task and everyone can’t do it appropriately. However, some authors really mastered this art and know the secret of turning their life’s story into the words perfectly.

Fashion is fabulous

After all, fashion is fabulous, and you're bound to have some strong and distinct opinions about what people should (or should not) be wearing. From pretty saris to urban street wear to formal gowns and tuxedos...there are so many things to talk about, so it shouldn't be hard to come up with a topic you love.

Get help from a tutor for essay on fashion in Hindi language

If you have trouble writing down and expressing your thoughts in Hindi, look for a teacher or friend to help you. If you need to, you can always use online translation services to help you translate your language into Hindi. However, I'm assuming your speak Hindi already, and you just want to find a ready-made essay you can pass in as your own work. Let me warn you that this is a big mistake.

Don't cheat

All over the world, teachers and professors are using software applications, such as Plagium and Copyscape, to check up on what their students are doing. If you copy an essay from off of the Internet, you're asking for a failing grade, or some worse punishment, such as being kicked out of school.

If your essay is due tomorrow and you haven't written a word, do it now, or ask your teacher for an extension. It's just an essay, and it's an essay on a pretty easy subject, so sharpen your pencil, jot down a few thoughts, and then use their notes to type up something awesome. You can do it - you don't have to cheat by stealing someone else's work; after all, you'll be more proud of yourself if you do it without breaking the rules."
0,"Doubt that you still need the assistance with your essay. Probably, somebody else will look for the answer. There was a sentence in the previous answer about not cheating. If you go to the online writing service, as Marvelous essay service, you will not have that feeling and you will be sure about the high quality of your work.    "

Employers these days are very busy with paperwork and whatnot, and they don't check their email as frequently as you think they would. So if you were to send your resume through email and asked for job employment, it'll get delayed because they won't read your email the instant you send it.

1,"In literature, the resolution is the ending: Part of the story where the main conflict has been resolved and the story is coming to a close.

The Five Elements of Plot In literature, many theorists agree that you can divide a narrative plot into five stages:
Exposition - This is the beginning of the story, where the character and settings are established.
Rising Action - This usually where the problem or conflict is introduced. Something happens to disrupt the state of equilibrium that was established in the expository stage. 
Climax - Here, everything is brought to a head; the main conflict occurs.
Falling Action - The main conflict is over, and the story begins to slow down, coming to a close. Imagine this as the aftermath of a fight; cleaning wounds, fixing broken bones, making sure everybody is okay.
Resolution - A new order is established; this might be a return to the state shown in the expository phase, or it might be a new one. For good or for bad, this is the ending."
1,"The resolution is the part of a story's plot line in which the problem of the story is resolved or worked out. This occurs after the action and is typically where the story ends. Another term for the resolution is ""denouement,"" which comes from the French term ""denoue,"" meaning ""to untie.""
Usually, any questions that arose during the story are answered in the resolution.  All stories have a resolution, even if the author doesn't disclose every lastdetail to the reader. order book report"

you need to drive more organic traffic to your websites, it is imperative to increase
the keyword ranking. And for this need, you can rely on some latest and
valuable SEO techniques. Here is the list of techniques that you can consider
to improve the keyword ranking.
ü  You should use long tail keywords because
they are less competitive and can make you receive more targeted traffic.
ü  If you get the high-quality backlinks, then
there will be the major hike in the keyword ranking.
ü  With the help of really detailed guides, you
will have more search visitors to your blog post."
1,"Page descriptions: Google may choose not to show your description on the SERPs, but it is still important to provide a custom description for each and every page of your website, especially the pages you want to rank higher.
Accurately describe the page content and include variations of your target keyword.
Look at the AdSense example above and see how nicely Google adds variations of its target keyword into the description (e.g., learn how to make money online, content monetization, make money).
H1 tags: Review your HTML code (open the page, go to “View Source” and search for H1). Check that your page has only one set of H1 tags. The H1 tag is not necessarily the same as your page title tag, but it should contain variations of your target keyword.
Page content: Back in 2011, Amit Singhal (head of Google’s ranking team) publishedan explanation of what Google considers to be a high-quality website. It’s one of the most important documents when it comes to SEO because it describes what Google is looking for when assessing a page’s value. Things like content quality, originality, formatting, in-depth analysis, presentation, and author trust play an important role.
Assuming that you got all those behind-the-scenes tips correct from the beginning, you need to ensure that your target keyword (and variations) is mentioned in the content of the page. I am not suggesting that you stuff the keywords in the text or over-optimize, but you need to check that the crawler in the page title and H1 tags are consistent with the page’s content.
Some tools can calculate the keyword density and make recommendations, but you don’t have to go that far; mentioning your keywords a couple of times in your content is enough.

3. Optimize Your Main Title Tag & Your Post Headline
A very important part of ensuring effective SEO is to optimize your main title tag. This ensures your site is more readily found when someone searches for the keywords. Thus, try using an interesting slogan, tagline or keyword just before your brand name.
The headline of every blog post or web page also needs to be SEO optimized. Ensure the headline is not only captivating enough for people to want to click but also descriptive enough to gain a better search engine rank.
4. Write An Engaging Meta Description
The term Meta description refers to the short description seen in search results below your headline. An engaging description will help in luring more traffic to your website.
5. Optimize Your Site Architecture & Your URL
Both users and also search engine spiders should not have to look very hard so as to find any content on your website. A general tip to use is to keep your most important web pages within at least three clicks from your homepage. An easy way of checking whether you have buried content too far is to evaluate your URL structure.
Having a clear and clean URL is also vital for building traffic through SEO. It not only makes your site quick and easy to crawl for the search engines, and also users can remember it easily and share.
6. Evaluate Usage Data & Website Speed
The usage data of your website has huge effect on your SEO practices. Evaluate this data and discover whether people are staying on your site for longer than one minute.
How quickly your website loads also affects your ranking on search engines. If your website loads too slowly due to excessive imagery of flash content along with other common performance problems, then it is high time to start evaluating ways of enhancing the loading speed
Off-Page SEO:
1. Build Audiences With Social Media (don’t forget Google +)
Social media has a great impact on your overall search results. Hence, a good place to start with off-page SEO is to create sharable content and post it in all your social media pages for effective link-building.
One simple trick to get more traffic is to use Google+ for business. It is heavily integrated with all aspects of Google and therefore sharing your content through this social media site will have a considerable effect on your overall search rankings.
2. Join Associations And Other Offline Groups
Offline associations and groups really have a positive effect on your SEO strategy, especially for building credibility for your website. You can also get indirect links from your peers, which all helps to position your website as one of the industry leaders in your field.
Links from schools and non-profits are quite valuable for SEO since they are considered as both high trust and high value. Consider donating either your money or time to a local charity in your area to receive these benefits.

Work Smart Not Hard - This Is Also One SEO Technique!!!
1. Build better content than your competitors. If they write content around 1000 words, you try to write around 1300 because the research says that the word count for ranking a website for mid-level of competition or higher the word count is around 2300.
2. Do better on-page seo like adding exact match keywords, LSI keywords and keyword density and more at relevant places [sprinkle them].
3. Add modifiers to the title.
4. Add LSI keyword in meta description.
5. Make use of heading tags properly.
6. Use images relevant and optimize them.
7. Proper internal linking.
8. Proper navigation of the site.
9. Put important posts or pages in sidebar google feels that these are important pages or posts of this site/blog.
10. First, find where your competitor is getting links and try the same for your website/blog.
11. If you want to rank locally, go for local seo like submitting local seo directories, google listings, local search engines and make sure you use your location in title and content so that google can know that this particular page is fit for specific location. [Follow NAP: Name Address Phone number]
12. If your business is not local, better do not go for local seo. [do not mention location]
13. Use proper outbound links that are do follow, many say that if you give a do follow an outbound link to similar website/blog of others you may lose link juice. That's not true - just imagine the web without links, its bit hard. The whole web is built with links, doing this tells Google that two pages have a similar topic. This is called link sculpting.
14. Try some link building techniques like web directories [only few which have high domain authority and page authoeity] because we can get trust and authority.
15. Try broken link building and etc., which are effective and your competitor cannot get.

1,"There are many ways to cook a chicken in the oven and really, its all down to personal taste which one you prefer. I'll share a few of my personal favourite ways of cooking a chicken in the oven and you can make up your own mind. I like:

• Roasting
• Pot roast
• Casserole
• Biryani

Roasting is the most straightforward way of cooking in the oven and produces golden crispy skin and tender, juicy meat.

• Preheat the oven to 160 (fan), 280F, 140c, gas 3
• Remove the giblets from the cavity of the chicken (if included) and rinse the chicken out with cold running water
• Pat the bird dry and smear the skin with butter, salt and pepper
• For additional flavour, try sprinkling dried thyme over the skin or slicing a lemon and placing slices between the skin and flesh for a great tangy flavour
• I personally place the bird breast side down into the pan (the juices run down into the breast as its cooking, making it extra tasty), but you can put the bird breast side upwards in the pan, its entirely your choice
• Cook for one hour at this low heat and then turn the oven up to 220 (fan), 390F, 200c, gas 7 and cook for a further 30 minutes to go crispy and golden.
• Cover loosely with foil and allow the chicken to rest for 10 minutes for carving

Pot roasting produces a similar juicy, tender meat, but does not brown the chicken in the same way as oven roasting.

• Preheat the oven to 150c, 300F, Gas 2
• Remove the giblets from the cavity (if included) and rinse the chicken well with cold running water
• Pat the bird dry and season inside and outside with salt and pepper
• Heat 2tbsp olive oil with 50g of butter in a large, heavy pot and add the chicken to the pot, turning over and and over to brown the skin all over. Remove from the pot.
• Add 150g of smoked bacon or pancetta and 10 cloves of garlic to the pot until golden.
• Add a generous splash of white wine and add 1kg of peeled, chunked potatoes and toss until covered in the mixture
• Add the chicken to the pot, among the potatoes and add a few sprigs of fresh thyme
• Add 300ml of chicken stock to the pot
• Bring the pan to the boil. Cover the pan and transfer to the oven for 1- 11/2 hours until the potatoes are cooked

Casserole is very similar to pot roast, except you cook the chicken in individual pieces, rather than the bird as a whole. This is my recipe for chicken chasseur

• Preheat the oven to 150c, 300F, Gas 2
• Season your chicken pieces and fry in a large, heavy saucepan until golden brown. Remove from the pan and add one chopped onion and fry until soft. Add 2 crushed garlic cloves and 200g of button mushrooms and cook for 2 - 3 minutes.
• Add 200ml of red wine to the pan and 2tbsp of tomato puree and cook for five minutes until it has reduced slightly.
• Add 3 - 4 thyme sprigs and stir in 500ml of chicken stock
• Add the chicken back to the pan, bring to the boil and simmer on a low heat for around an hour, until the chicken is cooked and tender
• Remove the chicken from the pan and keep warm. Bring the sauce back to the boil and reduce it down quickly for 10-12 minutes until the sauce has thickened slightly and is a rich dark colour.
• For a lower fat option, remove the skin from the chicken before browning

Biryani
This one-pot, rice-based dish is very popular in South Asia and arabian cultures and is really quick and easy to make.

• Wash 300g of basmati rice in water until the water runs clear
• Heat 25g butter in a large pan and fry a sliced onion with a bay leaf, 4 cardamom pods and a piece of cinnamon stick for 10 minutes.
• Add 4 chicken breasts, cut into chunks (or thighs), 1 tsp turmeric and 4tbsp of curry paste (its your choice) to the pan and cook for 5 minutes.
• Add the washed rice to the pan, along with a handful of raisins and 850ml of chicken stock.
• Add a good, tight fitting lid to the pan and bring it to a fast boil. Lower the heat to its lowest and cook for five more minutes.
• Turn off the heat, but leave the pan on the ring for 10 more minutes.
Remove the lid and stir in a handful of chopped coriander and a handful of flaked almonds or unsalted peanuts"

They use to ask about your introduction, so one should make an impressive introductory speech or whatever.

Another question that is common during job interviews is about your education. You need to be adept on whatever you have studied and whatever your qualification is. They may ask anything from it to test your mind.

They will also ask about your previous experience of jobs, so you should have a summarized paragraph to put forward at that time. Always share the positive points from the past job experiences. Very important thing that comes to the mind of questioner during and interview is that, why the other person is going to leave the old job and applying for this new job. So, you must know that is it a good salary, good environment, good people or which ever the thing may be, which is compelling you to go for this new job."

1,"Spam can be defined as irrelevant or unsolicited messages sent over the Internet. These are usually sent to a large number of users for a variety of use cases such as advertising, phishing, spreading malware, etc.
In the past, spam used to favor email as it was the primary communication tool. Email addresses were relatively easy to harvest via chat rooms, websites, customer lists and that impact a user’s address book. Eventually, email filters became more sophisticated, and more effectively decreased spam from clogging the inbox.
Since then, spammers have moved onto a new target: Social applications.
Fake accounts are key to social spamming: To gain credibility, these fake accounts will try to become ‘friends’ or follow verified accounts, e.g., celebrities and public figures with the hope that these accounts befriend or follow them back. When genuine accounts befriend or follow back fake accounts, it legitimizes the account and enables it to carry out spam activities.
Another way for spammers to attack is to hack into and take over a user’s account, spreading fake messages to the user’s authentic followers.

1,"There are a number of causes of unemployment in Pakistan.The most important of these causes is a non stop increasing population. Deteriorating law and order situation has slowed down the tempo of economic activity. Karachi is the biggest industrial base of our country. But investors are reluctant to invest there because of continuous unrest and violence.

Our educational system is also responsible for the high unemployment rate among the educated youth. The attitude of our youth towards the choice of a career is also unrealistic and unproductive. They want to get only some white-collar job. Rapid mechanization and computer technology are also causing unemployment.

Unnecessary and frequent strikes in factories have compelled the owners to go for automation and such technology as requires less manpower. Lack of infrastructure facilities, especially in the field of energy, telecommunication and transportation also prevent the industrialist from setting up new industries. Large scale smuggling which has flooded the market with cheaper goods poses a serious threat to the development of local industry. Tight bureaucratic control on the economy, inadequate credit facilities and complex tax system are also some important factors that are creating hurdles in the way of private sector investment in industrial projects."
1,"The main reason of unemployment is government is not keen in providing jobs to the fresh graduates .
Tahir and Shoaib 4m Tarbela Dam.RBC"
1,Main reason of unemployment in pakistan is corruption that why if any organization create any vacancy the will be a power applied by an MPA or MNA to select the candidate of his choice
1,"Main problem of unemployment in Pakistan is that whenever a new technology comes as Software or hardware then all the people starts studying about that. Then at the end, you will see ten thousand students of a particular field against 5 or 10 job vacancies.
I remember those days when every one talking about MBA. I have seen many people saying that MBA is good and we will do it.

Actually I am talking about those days when MBA was becoming popular. Many people join MBA even without thinking that there are many other fields, and if everyone does MBA then the competition will also be tough and as a result job will be less but applicants will be thousands times more than that.

Other reason is that in Pakistan, things are not handled in appropriate manner. Vacancies are less, but job seekers are more than that. Opportunities are not enough, and system of reference is so much indulged in our society that if a company need some employees then workers of that company will provide some resume to them of their relatives and friends so in this way many people don't get the opportunity to apply for those jobs. I know system of reference is every where in the world, but not to that extend as in our society.
But as these days software companies are growing and some new companies are starting their business very rapidly so I hope ratio of unemployment will become low soon."
1,Main problem of unemployment in Pakistan is use of latest machinery rather latest technology.
1,"The causes of unemployment in Pakistan are:

1 Lack of enough industries to employ ever increasing number of graduate in the country.

2 The government is not involving in capital expenditure which creates job."

Students prefer only that field which appeals their mind, the field which they think is the most glamours whether they are eligible for it or not and as a result, we see so many graduates wandering in the streets jobless."
1,"I think one important reason of unemployment is the increasing population day by day because Pakistan is a Islamic Country, so their is no concept of Family planing this is against the nature of God, peoples think like this"
1,"Unemployment is one of the major problems of Pakistan. The level of unemployment is moving up. The socio economic system of the country and institutions has failed to provide employment to the increasing labour force. The rate of expansion in industrial sector is very slow. The increasing labour force has not been absorbed. Increasing output of general education institutions is the major cause of educated young men's unemployment. Technical, professional and vocational institutions are limited in number.

Nationalization of industrial units very badly affected the investment industrial sector. The private investor shifted their capital to other countries. Employment in the private sector absolutely stopped for many years. The higher growth rate of population is the major causes of unemployment. The population has exceeded the optimum level. The resources of the country are limited.

Employment cannot be provided to the increasing labour force.
The cottage industries in rural areas had been faded out by the machine made goods. The artisans have been rendered unemployed. Educated young men like white collar jobs. They do not like to perform manual labour. The higher age of retirement in government services has blocked the employment of educated young men. Reemployment of civil and military high ranking offices in government corporations and agencies deprives the qualified men from employment."
1,"Unemployment is one of the major problems of Pakistan. It is the root cause of several other problems and is a result of a number of problems. High unemployment results in wastage of resources and depression of income. And most certainly it also effects the social and emotional life of a person.

According to a survey, the rate of open unemployment is around 7.5 percent. And this rate is drastically increasing with the passage of time. The unemployment rate is drastically increasing in both rural and urban areas of Pakistan.  In urban areas it is less than in rural areas because there are more industries and more opportunities."
0,"Ms.Butt

There are lot of reasons of unemployment in Pakistan, but the most crucial is the minimum wage laws.Young people don,t want to do work on a very low wage.so they remain unemployed.

Poverty is another factor which adds to unemployment. Because unfortunately,corruption has always been at its peak in all big employer's system/institutions in Pakistan. Due to poverty many of our graduates are unable to give a heavy amount for being selected or having an entry into any system."

1,"Many issues have contributed towards unemployment in Pakistan. Firstly, the instability of the government and each government deploying it's own people in all major organizations. Bribery leaves little space for educated people with good degrees. Jobs are not offered on the basis of experience and qualification but rather to please higher officials by offering it to their relatives or to  the people they recommend. People with MBA degrees do not want to take just any meagre job, they wait and hope for a better one that suits their educational qualifications. This results in an increase in the unemployment rate.
  Pakistan has the lowest literacy rate in the world. There is a lack of adapting and adopting new technologies that would help companies to grow and newer ones to mushrooM thus creating vacancies.

0,"The major causes of unemployment in Pakistan are as follows :

1) Limited resources which give rise to an increased competition.
2) A rigid class system and social communal divides which favor only a select few individuals over the others on the basis of pedigree and not on the basis of merit.
3) The two percent ruling elite favor the ones closes to them and hiring is decided on the basis of their links and political connection. Nepotism is a major problem in Pakistani job market."

0,"Causes of Unemployment in Pakistan 
The leading problem which the world is facing today is
unemployment. The ratio of unemployment is rising speedily due to lack of
sources and when unemployment takes place so many crimes are automatically be
created. Pakistanis the Asian country has many of problems in these days and
unemployment is one of those. Unemployment is caused numerous problems for its
people. Pakistan has incalculable natural resources but problem is that
resources are being wasted since the independence of Pakistan in 1947. The
people of Pakistan are considered extremely brilliant and hardworking in the
world and there is no significance of talent in Pakistan therefore it is the
reason many of engineers, doctors, Scientifics, technicians and accountants
travel in foreign countries for earn their livelihood.. Due to unemployment the
living standard of Pakistanis is going down with the passage of time. People
are unable to fulfill their basic needs. There are plenty of causes behind
unemployment some of the major causes of unemployment are as fallowing
Lack of Nation
Employment Policy
There has been lack of national employment policy in
Pakistan .so no specific policy was lay dawn to remove unemployment. There have
been no serious efforts at man power paining .due to the lack of the policy the
unemployment problem has reached to its peak.
Slow Growth of
Pakistan Economy
The increase in employment opportunities is intimately  related to growth of economy. Despite that
more than decades of planning the Pakistan economy is going dawn or in law
rate.
Privatization of
Governmental Agencies
One of the major causes of unemployment is also the
privatization of governmental agencies. When the government agency become
private they mostly higher new employees and fire the current employees due to
that many people become unemployed.
Poor Education
System:
The educational system of Pakistan is very poor since 1947.
Unfortunately any government since independence didn’t take remarkable steps to
make the education system good. Education system in Pakistan is uneven. It has
been seen even brilliant students left study due to wrong system. You can many
technical educational colleges and private technical institutions are being
found which are only selling degrees because technical education which is being
given in these institutions has no value, therefore people are wondering about
for jobs due to lack of experience and  skills.
Rapid Growth of
Population:
The rapid growth of population in Pakistan is one of the
most serious issues regarding unemployment. The population of Pakistan is
increasing at very high rate this time. According to the statistical the
population of Pakistan is increasing at the rate of 2.2%. There are many reasons
responsible for overpopulation such as early marriages, illiteracy, desires for
sons, lack of awareness, lack proper family paining etc. As we all know that
theeducation
system of Pakistan is very poor therefore increasing in
population means to bring more uneducated person into the field of labor.
Government or any other company cannot provide jobs or work places to this large
number of uneducated people at time.
Terror Activities:
One of other most serious cause of unemployment in Pakistan
is terrorism. Terrorist activities are on peak at this time in all-around of
Pakistan, therefore situation in Pakistan is really threatening and alarming
and due to this the nationals and as well as foreigners are frightened to
invest in Pakistan. So when investors will not invest so how can job or earning
opportunities are being created?
Arrival of Afghan
refugees
Arrival of afghan refugees to Pakistan is the further
problem of unemployment in Pakistan. These refuges are in Pakistan since 1979
after the attack of Russia due to this many of Afghans migrated to Pakistan for
making them save till the betterment situation of their country and the number
of these refuges increased after American army attacked on Afghanistan in 2001
about 13 years ago and the situation in Afghanistan is still critical. The
migrated people cause of unemployment in Pakistan.
Uncertainty and unrest in the country:
Insecurity and turbulence in
Pakistan and the worsening law and order situation has played a chief role in
transferring the business to other countries, noforeigninvestorsfeel safe and sound in investing in such a country in which their
businesses are not safe In Pakistan due to weak political system and unstable
governmental structure. None of foreign companies want to invest in unrest
environment which become the cause of unemployment in Pakistan
Energy Crisis
There are many sources of
producing of energy in Pakistan but due to lack of proper planning and efforts
Pakistan is having problem of energy crisis. The government of Pakistan is
unable to provide electricity to residential areas in Pakistan than how cansenergy or electricity can be provided to factories and industries.
Therefore factories and industries that are required energy are transferring
their business in other Asian countries like Bangladesh, India and as well as
Sri Lanka. As of this result a huge number of labors are becoming the victims
of unemployment.
Backward Agriculture
The biggest cause of unemployment in Pakistan is the
backwardness of agriculture sector.44% people get jobs from this sector  directly or indirectly unemployment and that
is the biggest sector of economy that contribute 20.9%GPD.there are two main
reason of agricultural backwardness
Adoption of Latest Machinery and capital intensive
technology the demand of labour has been decreased
There is less availability of fertilizers, pesticides,
quality seeds, absences of land reform lack of agriculture education
Absence of merit
system
In Pakistan There is the absence of merit system due
corruption in government and private agencies the people who are well qualified
and skillful remain unemployed.
Favoritism in
politics and lack of plan and management
Favoritism in politics and lack of plan and management has
also given birth to a confusing condition in this regard. The favoritism in
politics has created environment of self- aggrandizement so that everyone is
hit with his own interests to a great extent. Everybody chooses or supports and
seconds the party members of its own for certain posts. That is why a poor even
talented candidate faces joblessness. Moreover, lack of planned management for
the future has been paving the way for the economic scrambles in the country so
that the problem of employment is still unresolved satisfactorily industrialization

1,"There are a number of causes of unemployment in Pakistan.The most important of these causes is a non stop increasing population. Deteriorating law and order situation has slowed down the tempo of economic activity. Karachi is the biggest industrial base of our country. But investors are reluctant to invest there because of continuous unrest and violence.

Our educational system is also responsible for the high unemployment rate among the educated youth. The attitude of our youth towards the choice of a career is also unrealistic and unproductive. They want to get only some white-collar job. Rapid mechanization and computer technology are also causing unemployment.

Unnecessary and frequent strikes in factories have compelled the owners to go for automation and such technology as requires less manpower. Lack of infrastructure facilities, especially in the field of energy, telecommunication and transportation also prevent the industrialist from setting up new industries. Large scale smuggling which has flooded the market with cheaper goods poses a serious threat to the development of local industry. Tight bureaucratic control on the economy, inadequate credit facilities and complex tax system are also some important factors that are creating hurdles in the way of private sector investment in industrial projects."

1,Main reason of unemployment in pakistan is corruption that why if any organization create any vacancy the will be a power applied by an MPA or MNA to select the candidate of his choice
1,"Main problem of unemployment in Pakistan is that whenever a new technology comes as Software or hardware then all the people starts studying about that. Then at the end, you will see ten thousand students of a particular field against 5 or 10 job vacancies.
I remember those days when every one talking about MBA. I have seen many people saying that MBA is good and we will do it.

Actually I am talking about those days when MBA was becoming popular. Many people join MBA even without thinking that there are many other fields, and if everyone does MBA then the competition will also be tough and as a result job will be less but applicants will be thousands times more than that.

Other reason is that in Pakistan, things are not handled in appropriate manner. Vacancies are less, but job seekers are more than that. Opportunities are not enough, and system of reference is so much indulged in our society that if a company need some employees then workers of that company will provide some resume to them of their relatives and friends so in this way many people don't get the opportunity to apply for those jobs. I know system of reference is every where in the world, but not to that extend as in our society.
But as these days software companies are growing and some new companies are starting their business very rapidly so I hope ratio of unemployment will become low soon."
1,Main problem of unemployment in Pakistan is use of latest machinery rather latest technology.
1,"The causes of unemployment in Pakistan are:

1 Lack of enough industries to employ ever increasing number of graduate in the country.

2 The government is not involving in capital expenditure which creates job."
1,Unemployment is just because of the lack of education. People are not aware about the increasing fields...

1,"I am Sohail Rasheed, a student of mass communication. The main reason of unemployment in Pakistan is that there is no career counselling. Students prefer only that field which appeals their mind, the field which they think is the most glamours whether they are eligible for it or not and as a result, we see so many graduates wandering in the streets jobless."
1,"I think one important reason of unemployment is the increasing population day by day because Pakistan is a Islamic Country, so their is no concept of Family planing this is against the nature of God, peoples think like this"
1,"Unemployment is one of the major problems of Pakistan. The level of unemployment is moving up. The socio economic system of the country and institutions has failed to provide employment to the increasing labour force. The rate of expansion in industrial sector is very slow. The increasing labour force has not been absorbed. Increasing output of general education institutions is the major cause of educated young men's unemployment. Technical, professional and vocational institutions are limited in number.

Nationalization of industrial units very badly affected the investment industrial sector. The private investor shifted their capital to other countries. Employment in the private sector absolutely stopped for many years. The higher growth rate of population is the major causes of unemployment. The population has exceeded the optimum level. The resources of the country are limited.

Employment cannot be provided to the increasing labour force.
The cottage industries in rural areas had been faded out by the machine made goods. The artisans have been rendered unemployed. Educated young men like white collar jobs. They do not like to perform manual labour. The higher age of retirement in government services has blocked the employment of educated young men. Reemployment of civil and military high ranking offices in government corporations and agencies deprives the qualified men from employment."
1,"Unemployment is one of the major problems of Pakistan. It is the root cause of several other problems and is a result of a number of problems. High unemployment results in wastage of resources and depression of income. And most certainly it also effects the social and emotional life of a person.

According to a survey, the rate of open unemployment is around 7.5 percent. And this rate is drastically increasing with the passage of time. The unemployment rate is drastically increasing in both rural and urban areas of Pakistan.  In urban areas it is less than in rural areas because there are more industries and more opportunities."
0,"Ms.Butt

There are lot of reasons of unemployment in Pakistan, but the most crucial is the minimum wage laws.Young people don,t want to do work on a very low wage.so they remain unemployed.

Poverty is another factor which adds to unemployment. Because unfortunately,corruption has always been at its peak in all big employer's system/institutions in Pakistan. Due to poverty many of our graduates are unable to give a heavy amount for being selected or having an entry into any system."

1,"Lake of education so that,s why we are behind we should care about it"
1,"Many issues have contributed towards unemployment in Pakistan. Firstly, the instability of the government and each government deploying it's own people in all major organizations. Bribery leaves little space for educated people with good degrees. Jobs are not offered on the basis of experience and qualification but rather to please higher officials by offering it to their relatives or to  the people they recommend. People with MBA degrees do not want to take just any meagre job, they wait and hope for a better one that suits their educational qualifications. This results in an increase in the unemployment rate.
  Pakistan has the lowest literacy rate in the world. There is a lack of adapting and adopting new technologies that would help companies to grow and newer ones to mushrooM thus creating vacancies.

0,"The major causes of unemployment in Pakistan are as follows :

1) Limited resources which give rise to an increased competition.
2) A rigid class system and social communal divides which favor only a select few individuals over the others on the basis of pedigree and not on the basis of merit.
3) The two percent ruling elite favor the ones closes to them and hiring is decided on the basis of their links and political connection. Nepotism is a major problem in Pakistani job market."

Thirdly, lack of education and literacy is yet another reason for the unemployment as every one needs skilled labour.

The basic thing which I find about unamployment is our system of education because our students are not getting practically work they are getting education that is theoretically but not practically. And when they come in world market they get fail. So first proper planning regarding our educational system should be adoptd then hope so we can reduce the rate of unemployment from pakistan."

0,"Causes of Unemployment in Pakistan 
The leading problem which the world is facing today is
unemployment. The ratio of unemployment is rising speedily due to lack of
sources and when unemployment takes place so many crimes are automatically be
created. Pakistanis the Asian country has many of problems in these days and
unemployment is one of those. Unemployment is caused numerous problems for its
people. Pakistan has incalculable natural resources but problem is that
resources are being wasted since the independence of Pakistan in 1947. The
people of Pakistan are considered extremely brilliant and hardworking in the
world and there is no significance of talent in Pakistan therefore it is the
reason many of engineers, doctors, Scientifics, technicians and accountants
travel in foreign countries for earn their livelihood.. Due to unemployment the
living standard of Pakistanis is going down with the passage of time. People
are unable to fulfill their basic needs. There are plenty of causes behind
unemployment some of the major causes of unemployment are as fallowing
Lack of Nation
Employment Policy
There has been lack of national employment policy in
Pakistan .so no specific policy was lay dawn to remove unemployment. There have
been no serious efforts at man power paining .due to the lack of the policy the
unemployment problem has reached to its peak.
Slow Growth of
Pakistan Economy
The increase in employment opportunities is intimately  related to growth of economy. Despite that
more than decades of planning the Pakistan economy is going dawn or in law
rate.
Privatization of
Governmental Agencies
One of the major causes of unemployment is also the
privatization of governmental agencies. When the government agency become
private they mostly higher new employees and fire the current employees due to
that many people become unemployed.
Poor Education
System:
The educational system of Pakistan is very poor since 1947.
Unfortunately any government since independence didn’t take remarkable steps to
make the education system good. Education system in Pakistan is uneven. It has
been seen even brilliant students left study due to wrong system. You can many
technical educational colleges and private technical institutions are being
found which are only selling degrees because technical education which is being
given in these institutions has no value, therefore people are wondering about
for jobs due to lack of experience and  skills.
Rapid Growth of
Population:
The rapid growth of population in Pakistan is one of the
most serious issues regarding unemployment. The population of Pakistan is
increasing at very high rate this time. According to the statistical the
population of Pakistan is increasing at the rate of 2.2%. There are many reasons
responsible for overpopulation such as early marriages, illiteracy, desires for
sons, lack of awareness, lack proper family paining etc. As we all know that
theeducation
system of Pakistan is very poor therefore increasing in
population means to bring more uneducated person into the field of labor.
Government or any other company cannot provide jobs or work places to this large
number of uneducated people at time.
Terror Activities:
One of other most serious cause of unemployment in Pakistan
is terrorism. Terrorist activities are on peak at this time in all-around of
Pakistan, therefore situation in Pakistan is really threatening and alarming
and due to this the nationals and as well as foreigners are frightened to
invest in Pakistan. So when investors will not invest so how can job or earning
opportunities are being created?
Arrival of Afghan
refugees
Arrival of afghan refugees to Pakistan is the further
problem of unemployment in Pakistan. These refuges are in Pakistan since 1979
after the attack of Russia due to this many of Afghans migrated to Pakistan for
making them save till the betterment situation of their country and the number
of these refuges increased after American army attacked on Afghanistan in 2001
about 13 years ago and the situation in Afghanistan is still critical. The
migrated people cause of unemployment in Pakistan.
Uncertainty and unrest in the country:
Insecurity and turbulence in
Pakistan and the worsening law and order situation has played a chief role in
transferring the business to other countries, noforeigninvestorsfeel safe and sound in investing in such a country in which their
businesses are not safe In Pakistan due to weak political system and unstable
governmental structure. None of foreign companies want to invest in unrest
environment which become the cause of unemployment in Pakistan
Energy Crisis
There are many sources of
producing of energy in Pakistan but due to lack of proper planning and efforts
Pakistan is having problem of energy crisis. The government of Pakistan is
unable to provide electricity to residential areas in Pakistan than how cansenergy or electricity can be provided to factories and industries.
Therefore factories and industries that are required energy are transferring
their business in other Asian countries like Bangladesh, India and as well as
Sri Lanka. As of this result a huge number of labors are becoming the victims
of unemployment.
Backward Agriculture
The biggest cause of unemployment in Pakistan is the
backwardness of agriculture sector.44% people get jobs from this sector  directly or indirectly unemployment and that
is the biggest sector of economy that contribute 20.9%GPD.there are two main
reason of agricultural backwardness
Adoption of Latest Machinery and capital intensive
technology the demand of labour has been decreased
There is less availability of fertilizers, pesticides,
quality seeds, absences of land reform lack of agriculture education
Absence of merit
system
In Pakistan There is the absence of merit system due
corruption in government and private agencies the people who are well qualified
and skillful remain unemployed.
Favoritism in
politics and lack of plan and management
Favoritism in politics and lack of plan and management has
also given birth to a confusing condition in this regard. The favoritism in
politics has created environment of self- aggrandizement so that everyone is
hit with his own interests to a great extent. Everybody chooses or supports and
seconds the party members of its own for certain posts. That is why a poor even
talented candidate faces joblessness. Moreover, lack of planned management for
the future has been paving the way for the economic scrambles in the country so
that the problem of employment is still unresolved satisfactorily industrialization

0,"The answer is simply that you can’t do it specifically.  Google finds images from various websites and adds them to their Image Search, when a relevant key word or phrase is typed in.

If you have posted your photos on a website for example and your name features alongside it on that page somewhere, the pictures may appear in the Google Image Search.  If you really want to do this then you can post your photos on forums, or other websites to try and get Google to add them.  Here is how to do so:

Upload your photos to your computer and name them accordingly.

Work out which websites you want to post them to.  This may be a forum, your own website, a Flickr page, or an image hosting service, such as imageshack.us

If you use an image hosting service, then upload the photo(s), then make sure they are set to a public view, so everyone can see them.  This way Google will be able to add them to their Image Search.

It may take a while before they appear in the Google Image Search.  You can add relevant keywords to the website on which your photo is uploaded to help trigger the search results for that page.  You may want them to be more specific and less common if you want them to appear on the first page of the image results.

Type various relevant keywords into Google to see if your photos have shown up.

If you don’t want anyone to see your photos, perhaps because they are private, copyrighted to you or personal then do not upload them to the internet, as they will then be available for everyone to view and even re-use or edit."

There are three major groups covered by Search Engine Land’s Periodic Table Of SEO Success Factors:
On-the-page SEO
Off-the-page SEO
Violations
Within each group are subgroups, as each chapter of this SEO guide will explain. These subgroups contain one or more individual SEO factors with a specific weight or importance.
Violations, while a group unto themselves, are displayed under the group and subgroup to which they’re associated.
Those two-letter acronyms you see on the chart above? That’s our play on the periodic table of elements and the letter representations, or symbol, of each element. You may have had to remember that the symbol for gold was Au or that iron was Fe.
In the Periodic Table of SEO, we’ve tried to make it slightly more intuitive. The first letter of each “SEO element” comes from the subgroup that it’s in, and the second letter stands for the individual factor.
SEO factors work in combination
No single SEO factor will guarantee search engine rankings. Having a great HTML title won’t help if a page has low-quality content. Having many links won’t help if they are all low in quality. Having several positive factors can increase the odds of success, while the presence of negative factors can worsen those odds.
On-the-page success factors
On-the-page search ranking factors are those that are almost entirely within the publisher’s own control. What type of content do you publish? Are you providing important HTML clues that help search engines (and users) determine relevancy? How does your site architecture help or hinder search engines?
on page SEO tools for free, https://www.prepostseo.com.
Off-the-page success factors
Off-the-page ranking factors are those that publishers do not directly control. Search engines use these because they learned early on that relying on publisher-controlled signals alone didn’t always yield the best results. For instance, some publishers may try to make themselves seem more relevant than they are in reality.
With billions of web pages to sort through, looking only at “on-the-page” clues isn’t enough. More signals are needed to return the best pages for any particular search.
SEO violations & ranking penalties
Make no mistake — search engines want people to perform SEO because it can help improve their search results. Search engines provide help in the form of guidelines, blog posts, and videos to encourage specific SEO techniques.
However, there are some techniques that search engines deem “spam” or “black hat,” which could result in your pages receiving a ranking penalty, or worse, being banned from the search engines entirely.
Violations are general tactics meant to deceive or manipulate a search engine’s understanding of a site’s true relevancy and authority.
A weighting of search ranking factors
All the factors we show are weighted on a scale of 1 to 3, as shown in the top right corner of each factor, as well as reflected in the hue of that factor. A weighting of 3 is most important and is something you should pay special attention to because it has a bigger impact than other factors.
That doesn’t mean that factors weighted 2 or 1 aren’t important; they are. It’s just that they are of less importance, relatively speaking, in terms of the other factors on the chart. Violations are also weighted, but in negative numbers, with -3 being the worst and potentially most harmful to your SEO success.
The weighting is based on a combination of what search engines have said, surveys of the SEO community and our own expertise and experience in watching the space over time. We don’t expect them to be perfect. Not everyone will agree. Your mileage may vary. But we’re confident it is a useful general guide."

1,Search engine optimization (SEO) is the practice of increasing the quantity and quality of traffic to your website through organic search engine results.SEO is two type 1. On page SEO. 2. Off-page SEO.
1,"Basically the Search engine optimization (SEO) is the process of affecting the online visibility of a website or a web page in a web search engine's unpaid results—often referred to as ""natural"", ""organic"", or ""earned"" results.
There are two types of SEO:
On-page
Off-page
There are a huge variety of the SEO Tools are available to facilitate the users for optimization. Basically the SEO Tools Every Serious Blogger Needs Every day to perform the SEO audits, strategies for optimizations."
1,"SEO stands for “search engine optimization.” It is the process of getting traffic from the “free,” “organic,” “editorial” or “natural” search results on search engines.
There are three major groups covered by Search Engine Land’s Periodic Table Of SEO Success Factors:
On-the-page SEO
Off-the-page SEO
Violations
Within each group are subgroups, as each chapter of this SEO guide will explain. These subgroups contain one or more individual SEO factors with a specific weight or importance.
Violations, while a group unto themselves, are displayed under the group and subgroup to which they’re associated.
Those two-letter acronyms you see on the chart above? That’s our play on the periodic table of elements and the letter representations, or symbol, of each element. You may have had to remember that the symbol for gold was Au or that iron was Fe.
In the Periodic Table of SEO, we’ve tried to make it slightly more intuitive. The first letter of each “SEO element” comes from the subgroup that it’s in, and the second letter stands for the individual factor.
SEO factors work in combination
No single SEO factor will guarantee search engine rankings. Having a great HTML title won’t help if a page has low-quality content. Having many links won’t help if they are all low in quality. Having several positive factors can increase the odds of success, while the presence of negative factors can worsen those odds.
On-the-page success factors
On-the-page search ranking factors are those that are almost entirely within the publisher’s own control. What type of content do you publish? Are you providing important HTML clues that help search engines (and users) determine relevancy? How does your site architecture help or hinder search engines?
on page SEO tools for free, https://www.prepostseo.com.
Off-the-page success factors
Off-the-page ranking factors are those that publishers do not directly control. Search engines use these because they learned early on that relying on publisher-controlled signals alone didn’t always yield the best results. For instance, some publishers may try to make themselves seem more relevant than they are in reality.
With billions of web pages to sort through, looking only at “on-the-page” clues isn’t enough. More signals are needed to return the best pages for any particular search.
SEO violations & ranking penalties
Make no mistake — search engines want people to perform SEO because it can help improve their search results. Search engines provide help in the form of guidelines, blog posts, and videos to encourage specific SEO techniques.
However, there are some techniques that search engines deem “spam” or “black hat,” which could result in your pages receiving a ranking penalty, or worse, being banned from the search engines entirely.
Violations are general tactics meant to deceive or manipulate a search engine’s understanding of a site’s true relevancy and authority.
A weighting of search ranking factors
All the factors we show are weighted on a scale of 1 to 3, as shown in the top right corner of each factor, as well as reflected in the hue of that factor. A weighting of 3 is most important and is something you should pay special attention to because it has a bigger impact than other factors.
That doesn’t mean that factors weighted 2 or 1 aren’t important; they are. It’s just that they are of less importance, relatively speaking, in terms of the other factors on the chart. Violations are also weighted, but in negative numbers, with -3 being the worst and potentially most harmful to your SEO success.
The weighting is based on a combination of what search engines have said, surveys of the SEO community and our own expertise and experience in watching the space over time. We don’t expect them to be perfect. Not everyone will agree. Your mileage may vary. But we’re confident it is a useful general guide."

I can advise you to start with casino cruise bonus, it's free and useful for beginners, you can play there just for fun without paying real money :) bet365 casino, zodiac casino and mr green casino are my favourites too, they have nice bonuses, cool graphic and are totally safe for players.
The last one is really important in this case because sadly among online casinos there's so much scam... I strongly recommend you to use no scam tips before playing with the ones you've chosen on your own, without this you can lose really great amounts of money. Always play only safe online casinos!
And good luck of course :)"
1,"A system administrator's job is not easy. He is responsible for the safety and protection of all the servers and computers in an office. He is responsible for keep the computers free of any viruses and make it smooth for all the employees. If anything goes wrong with any of the computers, the system administrator is held responsible. A system administrator's negligence can put a company at a big risk. It is better to go prepared for a system administrator's job. During the interview, the interviewer may ask you some questions all relating to the server.

He may ask you how well call you protect and save. He may ask some of your ideas on how to improve the security. He may also take a small test of you regarding the security of a server. It is very important to stay alert at all times because that is what is required for a system administrator's job."
1,"To talk about your biggest failure in an interview you first must decide, if and when, you have experienced such a failure. Maybe you have never experienced anything you would call a big failure. Depending upon your age, and life experiences, not being aware of a big failure, may be the truth for you. If, this is the case then you need to state this in your interview.

When children grow up in a loving and caring family, a family that is supportive, a family, in which everyone helps everyone else to achieve their goals, big failures do not always happen to them. Even in homes where you are put down for failures this does not mean you are a failure. Failures should be treated as obstacles to overcome not as permanent reminders, to keep you feeling bad about yourself.

If you have never experienced a big failure, just answer this way. I really have never experienced what I would call a big failure. I try to deal with mistakes as learning experiences. If, I fail to reach a goal, I try harder the next time. I am sure I have failed at times, but I do not spend time fretting over these things. I try to focus on doing my best each day, and some days I succeed and some days I do not, but to me it is the effort which counts.

Now, if in fact you have experienced something you believe was a big failure. First state, that while you are aware what happened was a mistake, you learned from the mistake, and that is past history. Today, my focus is looking forward, not backward. I can tell you about my mistake, but I would rather talk about the successes in my life, and who I am at this moment and who I hope to become. I have no problem admitting mistakes, I would be ashamed of my failures, only if, I did not have the intelligence to move beyond them, and strive for higher goals."
0,"Do not listen to Jomar... Terrible idea.  Most interviewers don't care what kind of failure you have.  These kind of questions are to see who you are.  If you said what Jomar said for not having any big failure, you will definitely see failure after your interview.  Interviewers want to see how you learned, adapt, and changed from your failure.  Doesn't matter what kind of degree it is, to be honest, they can't tell you if your failure is your biggest or not... So just give anything with a good story."
0,"When you are asked about a failure in a
interview, it's important not to describe a failure that can seriously embarrasses
you. Rather, you want to show something where you made a mistake and were able
to overcome it, learn from it, and perform better in the long run.
Then you want to tell a story of a
situation where you made that mistake, how you reacted to it, gathered
information, feedback, advised a plan to correct that mistake, and the steps
you took to correct for it.
Ultimately, what you learned because of
that mistake and how the results were still positive at the end. So, in
thinking about a mistake that you made that you want to tell an interview, look
for that criteria a story that fits that, rather than potentially the largest
mistake of your life."
0,"When the interviewer asks about your biggest failure,
Talk about your real life experiences and how come you have faced that failure and what you have learnt from that.
If at all you still not experienced any failure try to expose something which you have seen.
You should speak in such a way that, that is a drastic change in my life and gently i managed and come out of that likewise you should speak.
Failures are the stepping stones of success. Ans you should say as after facing the failure i understood what exactly life mean and now I am  very much clear and strong to face any kind of situation.
Likewise you should be in a position to answer any type of question in the interview. There are some practice online interviews like InterviewBuddy- https://medium.com/@interviewbuddy/how-to-ace-an-interview-the-practical-guide-9a0e7a36425dteam  where you get extreme answers from the industry experts."

1,"Graduating and applying for a job can be quite stressful, but there are many ways that you can build up your confidence and become successful in getting the job you want. 
Here are some tips on building up confidence at interviews, in order to get your dream job!
Believe in yourself
It can often be difficult to get the self confidence you need when you are under the watchful eye of a potential employer. 
However it is always important to believe in yourself. The employer would not have even called you for an interview if they didn't feel that you have something to offer. Think about your strengths and what you could bring to the company and let that shine through.
Put yourself in the mindset of the employer: What are the things that you'd want to here from a potential employee? What contributions would you want from a potential employee?
Preparation is key
If you do feel nervous at interviews it may help to get extra preparation prior to the interview. The more you prepare for the interview the less nervous you should feel. You could try going through a list of potential questions and thinking about what you might say. 
It may also be helpful to look at the company background and what you could offer them.
Focus on the postives
Try to focus on the positive things that you could personally bring to the company. Do you have any good examples of work experience? 
Perhaps you could mention these examples if relevant and back up your positive attributes and achievements with examples. This will not only impress the employer but will also boost your confidence.
Try not to stress
Attending interviews can be nerve wracking but try not to get too stressed over it. Take a deep, calm breath and try your best. 
At the end of the day if you prepare well, smile and try your best at the interview then you know that you have done everything you can. Ultimately you will land the perfect job for you when you and the employer believes that you are the right fit for the position and it will happen!
I hope this helps to answer your question :)"

0,"How to move easily from one para to the next in an essay
 As you know,
Essays are written in paras. First par will be the intro and last will be the
conclusion. The number of body paras has no limit. It depends upon the wideness
of the topic. But the there should be a connection between every para you
write. This can be done in three ways.

  Via a link
sentence at the end of last para: Here, at the end of last para, you write a
sentence that makes the examiner feel what is coming next. Let us say you have
just written a para about the risk caused by AI to jobs. At the ending of that
para you can make a link sentence— “Moreover, we must be aware of the fact that
AI poses a major challenge not just economically, but also morally.” In the coming
para, you can write about the moral issues related to AI. Check for essay writing service
  Through a
question: Other than a link sentence, you can add a question at the end of a
para that can also make the examiner feel what is coming next. To take the same
example as above, the question can be a bit like— “Thus we have seen the threat
posed by AI to our world, but what about the risks brought by AI to our moral
values?” And in the next para, you can write about the moral issues related to
AI.
  Giving a one
word term at the start of next para is the other one.  Here you can add one or two words at the
beginning of a para. It will point a
shift in your subtopic. For instance, after writing a para about its historical
impact in an essay on Globalization, You can begin the next para somewhat like—
“Politically also, globalization has had a huge impact” This way examiner directly
knows what to expect. These steps will ensure that the changes between paras
are not rapid."
1,"Base your self-description around your suitability for the position and focus your presentation around your strengths, relating them to your ability to contribute something invaluable to both your potential employer and their company. Offer examples of your merit wherever possible; everyone enters a interview as a hard-working, responsible and trustworthy individual, and you're not going to stand out a bit from them unless you tell your interviewer exactly why you're deserving of your title. As a final point, try to let your personality shine through. A little genuineness can go a long way.

While it can be difficult to figure out how best to sell yourself to a potential employer, the process becomes a little easier  once you've determined your ultimate selling point. It doesn't have to be something that others have commended you for in the past; rather, figure out what makes you most proud of yourself as a professional.

From there, branch this pride point out as far as you can. What has it meant for your success? What has it taught you? Why is it relevant to the position for which you're applying? Keep adding new items and keep answering the above questions. Go on until you're sick of writing about yourself. Then take a break, put your notebook down, and look it over after a few hours have passed.

With a fresher mind, pick and choose the items that you feel say the most about you while best advertising your suitability. Keep an eye open for unique traits that you express better than most people. You won't want to flood your description with these traits, but one or two should do you well.

Finally, rearrange what you have until you feel confident in your description. Don't focus too much on what you think the interviewer will want to hear. Instead, put together something that allows you to communicate why you are a perfect fit for the job."
1,"Always talk about your achievements. Do not talk too much about your family education, as this will be of no relevance. Recommendation is always talk about your projects, if any. Then talk about the situation and how you found a resolution. Make a note of the pointers and then discribe them. This will make interviewee think that you always organise your work well. Ask for sometime to answer questions, as your immediate response may lead you to fall short of words.

Regards,
Shitij Sharma"
1,"When you apply for a job, talk abt the relate situation that will help your interviewer to think that they found the right guy. What all you done in past will not of much importance. Talk abt how you will handle a situation. Always go for an interview with a pen and a paper. Ask for sometime before answering. Make headers and then talk abt them. Explain them well."
1,"Interview is the very first impression of a person in an organization. We all know that first impression is the last impression. You should give an appropriate introduction in the start of interview. It is better to use English during an interview. You should introduce yourself as a job seeker. You should tell them about yourself by and by. Albeit it will take time but you have to do it in a nutshell. Don't waste a lot of time in telling them useless and irrelevant things about your self. You just need to tell them superficially.
Focus on your achievements in life. Also focus on your educational qualifications and your job experience. Hope you must know how to explore the best part of yours. It is better to talk more but if you think that you are an outspoken person then you should mind talking very less.
One should be careful in facing the interview. It is important to dress decently. You should not look either casual or over-dressed. You should look a gentleman/lady. It is important to make decent shave if you are a guy otherwise you should go for light make-up if you are a female."
1,"Tell of any eduction you have in the field.  Tell of any work experience you have in the field.  Tell of general education level.  Tell of any work experience.  Tell why you want the job.  Tell how you would help the company by getting this job.  Tell of any interests or activities you have that are relevant to the job. Tell why hiring you would be a good decision.  Also, when I went on interviews, I always dressed the way I would dress if I got the job and they wanted me to start that day.  Don't dress in a suit if you're going to be working on a farm and don't wear jeans and a T-shirt if you're going to work in an office."
1,"The best approach is to tell your real self. Be frank and make sure that your positive traits make a commendable impression to the interviewer. You can also tell about your negative traits but again, be sure of what measures you took/are taking to counter these negative aspect of yours. These should be put in a nice, convincing format so that the interviewer is more impressed at the end."
1,"Some people may describe themselves to make themselves sound great but honesty is the best policy !!
You should think about your behaviour and attitude toward life/friends etc. And try to find a word that describes you best.
For example for me it would be thoughtful because I am always thinking."
1,"In any type of interview, the first basic interview question is “ Tell me about yourself”?
Your answer should be confident.
First, you have thanked the interviewer….. “Firstly, I would like to thank you for giving this opportunity and it’s pleasure to introduce myself”.
Tell your name and location where your locating…. “I am (name) I belong to (city)”.
Tell your qualification….. “ Coming to my qualification.
My highest qualification is MBA with the stream of (branch) in ( college name) completed in (year).
I have completed my B.tech with the stream of (branch) in ( college name) completed in (year).
I have completed intermediate in (college name).
I have completed my 10th in (school name)”.
After your qualification details, you have to tell your skills…. “ I am quite good at (Digital Marketing skills or Programming skills)”.
You have to tell about your academic project.
If you any experience in any company previously you have told that.
Tell your Strength and Weakness.
Tell your Family background…..“ We are 4 including me My father (name) and he is working in (company name). My mother is the housewife and my brother/sister studying (qualification) in (college name).
That’s It, Sir.

A breakeven examination will enable you to decide to what extent it will take before you'll have the capacity to turn a benefit. Ensure that you comprehend the substances of maintaining your business ""in the red"": Would you be able to truly sit tight 2-3 years for a benefit?
Subsidizing Sources
Odds are that you wouldn't have the capacity to totally support your business wander alone. Things being what they are, the place is the capital you require going to originate from? A bank? A financial specialist? Family? Ensure that you know the amount you will require and where you will be getting it from.
Showcasing Plan
How are you going to pull in clients to your new business and make them mindful of your quality? What's exceptional and one of a kind about what you will offer, and to whom will you offer it? Know your group of onlookers and how you will transform them into clients.
Leave Strategy
It might appear to be odd to consider how you will leave your business when you're just barely starting to consider beginning it, yet your leave technique may impact how you assemble your business. Is this business going to be a transient wander, or would you say you are anticipating passing it down to your kids? You'll need to make this progress as smooth as conceivable when it comes, so ensure that you are setting up your business in a way that will lawfully take into account this.
2. Concoct A Name
Making sense of your business' name is a more included process than simply drawing up a rundown and picking your top pick; you'll need a name that is anything but difficult to recollect yet one of a sufficiently kind to discover on the web. In the event that potential clients run a web scan for your name, would they say they will locate twelve different businesses, or would they say they will locate your new business? Check with your province assistant or secretary of state to check whether somebody in your general vicinity as of now has a business with your name. Likewise, run a trademark look online to check whether your name is untaken, and check whether your space's name will be accessible for your site.
3. Do Your Due Diligence
How is your business going to be exhausted? What number of proprietors will there be? What will the possession structure be? Is it true that you will require proficient obligation protection, laborer's comp, item risk protection, or business property protection? It is safe to say that you will require a government work recognizable proof number or a merchant's allow for retail products? Shouldn't something be said about neighborhood grants and business licenses? Medicinal services for your representatives? What amount do you have to charge in deals impose? These are the sorts of inquiries you'll need to have the responses to before you open your front entryways. All things considered, ignoring duties, directions, or compulsory licenses can arrive your fresh out of the box new business in a bad position. Keep in mind that you don't have to do this in solitude (and most likely shouldn't!): Counsel a legal advisor, bookkeeper, protection specialist, or kindred business person.
4. Open A Business Bank Account
You might be amazed at the sorts of arrangements you can get when setting up a business financial balance. Make sure to search around and take a gander at something beyond your nearby bank. Contemplate what you'll conceivably require from your new bank. Possibly having portable check store will be urgent for your business, or perhaps you need a boundless number of month to month exchanges. Likewise, recall that you'll likely need some kind of credit/charge card preparing gear or a framework like Square.
5. Make Sense Of The Cost
There's no chance to get around it; opening up another business will be costly. Right now is an ideal opportunity to take a seat and truly consider your financial plan. What amount of will you be spending every month all alone lease/contracts, medical coverage, and bills? Be sensible about what you will and won't have the capacity to relinquish, and leave space for some adaptability. You would prefer not to fall behind on your own costs while additionally attempting to keep your new business above water.

Your new business is likely going to incur significant injury on your own life too.

On the off chance that you have enormous occasions coming up in your life (the introduction of a child or a wedding to design, for instance), you might need to sit tight for things to settle down before beginning in on your business too.
6. Decide Your Role
As we said some time recently, it's by and large not prescribed to endeavor to open another business totally all alone. You might be enthusiastic about preparing cakes or offering shirts, however how energetic would you say you are tied in with bookkeeping, managing lawful issues, and dealing with the day by day bothers? Regardless of whether it's contracting workers, expediting a specialist, or getting a bookkeeper, you'll most likely need the assistance of other individuals. It might entice to trust that you'll have the capacity to do this by itself and spare yourself some cash, however blunders in your accounting, an inability to acquire legitimate licenses, or even simply being grouchy and restless with clients since you are so focused can possibly wind up costing you significantly more!
7. Set Up Your Route To Market

In case you're hoping to have a physical area, ensure that you comprehend the area that you're moving into and your potential rivalry. Are the clients that you need to pull in here? Likewise consider how much lease you'll practically have the capacity to bear the cost of and whether the property you're keen on is appropriately zoned for your kind of business and hours.
8. Remain Inspired
Feeling overpowered by every one of that necessities to complete? Pondering whether it's truly justified, despite all the trouble? Now and again all that it takes to get re-roused is to converse with your care group—your family, companions, and so on. Making a stride once again from the little points of interest and helping yourself to remember the 10,000 foot view and the end amusement is vital to do all through the procedure. Keep in mind that all these little irritations you're managing now will help manufacture your business to be far superior.

As yet feeling down? Read about Michael Dell (began Dell Inc. Out of his condominium), Sam Walton (opened his initially store with $5,000 of his funds and a $20,000 credit from his dad; went ahead to establish Walmart), Sara Blakely (started creating Spanx with $5,000 of her own reserve funds, testing her models on her mom and companions), or any of alternate scores of people who began little and went ahead to be the proprietors of massively fruitful organizations. It is conceivable. Who's to state that you aren't next?

Opening a private company won't be simple, and it won't be straightforward, however recall that countless individuals do it consistently. Remain sorted out, and separate the procedure into little advances. Understand this isn't something that will occur without any forethought, and handle one thing at any given moment. It might be a test, yet that will simply make the reward considerably sweeter."

1,"Since the 80's the twentieth century, the steel as a building material, being all the more broadly utilized, this office and business building temporary workers in the execution is especially critical. In private development, the steel is likewise a specific extent of the market. Steel structure is basically utilized for rooftop and veneer on the system. In any case, from another perspective, the pieces of the overall industry of steel isn't perfect, principally because of specialized constraints by 80's, Steel Structure Maintenance Companies, item extend is exceptionally restricted.

90's of monetary retreat moderated the force of advancement of private steel, and after that recuperating fairly in a couple of years. Amid this period, the planners and structural designers have completed a ton of productive research, the most illustrative of a development is the creation of steel rib, utilize the steel ribs of the light steel mythical serpent divider, no longer a 'frosty extension' marvel.

This exposition demonstrates the historical backdrop of steel developments, outlined prologue to these building attributes, structure and notwithstanding including the development, structural parts of a few cases. Additionally demonstrates what is steel structure and the highlights of steel structure and strong qualities and wellbeing.
Presentation
In numerous industrialized nations like the United States, Japan, Britain and Australia, steel is most well known in private building action. In Australia the half of private building is made by steel structure; over half of steel structure is utilized for developments in Japan; and in Finland, Sweden, Denmark and France have shaped a specific size of modern steel building framework.

In U.S. The steel structure is for the most part utilized for multi-story flats, lodgings, the principal steel development was planned in 1990. So far an aggregate zone of the steel structure is produced till roughly 300,000 m2. Up to now, to utilize the steel structure in the low-ascent development in the U.S has created 25% from 5% of every 90's, and innovation of utilization the steel structure has developed and consummated.

The historical backdrop of steel structure in Japan is over 100 years. As of late the steel structure development has been immediately created in Japan, steel building development was expanded every year to half as of not long ago since 1965. Utilize 90% of steel structure for low-ascent building is exceptionally regular in Japan, there are utilize roughly 30 tons of steel structure for normal region of 300 m2 of development.
History of steel structure
The primary utilized of steel structure in development of nations can be followed back to the finish of eighteenth century in British.

If you want to reduce the usage of your Hp toner or ink cartridges, you could try to do the following.
1.Printer’s software or driver settings are the key points.
Software interface would help you access and tweak most of the functions of the printer, and the driver of the printer is a program to control the printer (in some case, the driver is the only way to change setting). No matter what you use, you could use the below 3 mode when you print to save the ink or toner.
At first, you should find an ink-saver or toner-saver mode.
Second, remember to use draft mode whenever you print, unless you need presentation-quality. Third, if possible, print in black and white instead of color.
What’s the most important, if your printer supports duplex printing, use it and you could save some paper.
2.Buy compatible toner & ink cartridges

But it is important for you to choose brand that could guarantees the quality of products.

When using older cartridges, the particulate matter may be discharged from the solution and clog the nozzle. To prevent this, Please do not use the toner cartridges during the warranty period. In addition, the capacity of the cartridge is matched to the actual quantity of printer to avoid large capacity cartridges out of time. (It is also a good idea to clean the nozzles on a regular basis - the printer should have a cleaning nozzle and print out the test paper settings.)
Using a laser printer, the toner settles over time, resulting in uneven distribution of printed pages, faded areas and fringes. If your laser print quality deteriorates, remove the toner cartridge from the printer, and shake it. You may be able to do this before the cartridge actually needs to be replaced.

If it's just a sleep issue, maybe Benadryl (diphenhydramine) as a temporary/short-term drug.

1,"Hi there - It's a little difficult to know where to begin as you have just said you have a ‘period’ related problems.  Without knowing the specifics of your question I’ll try and cover the main type of problems girls/women experience with their periods.
First things first - What is your period?
It’s simply the body’s way - when you are old enough - of getting ready to have a baby. Each month your ovaries produce and release an egg.  If the egg gets fertilized by male sperm - you get pregnant.  If nothing happens, all the nutrients and blood that your body has stored to look after the egg is no longer needed, so your body lets it go - and you get your period. It should happen about every 28 days.
Some women face irregular periods Unless you’re just at puberty or coming up to the menopause when your period can be a bit ‘hit and miss’ - it could be that something else is happening. Things that can make your period irregular are, stress, your weight (putting on too much and losing too much), and doing too much exercise. If you are on contraceptives then they may be causing you a problem also.  A condition known as Polycystic Overy syndrome can cause irregular periods. You should see your doctor about this. There are other things like Thyroid problems which may affect your periods also.
Another very common problem women face is heavy periods - so heavy that they impact daily life. If that’s your problem you should see your doctor. because you can get help. Sometimes you will be offered a contraceptive pill or other drugs that will help. Your doctor may send you for tests to see if you have fibroids - and if you do these can be removed.                                                                     

Pre-Menstrual Syndrome can cause some women a great deal of misery every month - I know because I suffered with this! My mood would swing back and forth and my family would know not to cross me at this time! A friend told me to take Evening Primrose oil and I have to say it helped me.  Other women I know have had to go to their doctor because they symptoms were so severe.
My daughter in law had something called Endometriosis which caused her so many problems with her period- it was very heavy and she had pain and constipation as well! It made her thoroughly miserable and on top of all that she was having problems conceiving. Thankfully she was able to control it with hormone treatment and when it settled down also managed to get pregnant!
Your period should happen regularly, once a month with only a small incoinconvenienceut if it’s more than that I encourage you not to put up with it and go see your doctor to get help-don’t put it off!"

 If I watch TV it tends to be along the lines of David Attenborough, humans living in diverse settings or history. What have I learned? That mankind is unnatural in its way, and destructive, we wasn't always so. That tribes live long lives without western medicine, for they have lived in harmony with the spirit of nature. It hasn't been western society teaching tribal culture how to cure but the other way round. Much of our sickness is due to living in close proximity and the state of our food source.  
As for religious texts many point to Sumer the first civilisation whether they have created many gods or used all those god traits in one. Why did we settle and create elaborate buildings and sewage systems? Domesticate cattle and wild grass, create a banking system? All that has ended us here. Wherever we are so is concrete, toxins and poverty. Why would nomad tribes who lived in harmony with the land for thousands of years, choose to settle when common sense told them that creating a surplus food supply makes it vulnerable to control? Whoever controls the food source controls everyone. People talk about religious ideas brainwashing man, many ideas brainwash man besides religion. If they didn't we certainly wouldn't be working at least 40 hours a week, or being fined for rules we did not make. Common law says you ""must not harm your neighbour."" Yet here we are bogged down with statutes and contract law of which none follow that common law, they are there to make our corporations money and everything is a corporation a legal entity.  Still they have enslaved and examined human interaction for years.
 Bill Gates is for vaccination to control the population. Their intent has always been create conflict through polarity, create the solution once society has had enough and has no where else to turn. Then society remains loyal to their masters. Put Christian up against Muslim, Atheist up against Theist and Republican up against Democrat. The result is the same totalitarianism masked as choice.
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=7XRUEuVP2qE
We shall unleash the nihilists and the atheists and we shall provoke a great social cataclysm which in all its horror will show clearly to all nations the effect of absolute atheism; the origins of savagery and of most bloody turmoil.Then everywhere, the people will be forced to defend themselves against the world minority of the world revolutionaries and will exterminate those destroyers of civilization and the multitudes disillusioned with Christianity whose spirits will be from that moment without direction and leadership and anxious for an ideal, but without knowledge where to send its adoration, will receive the true light through the universal manifestation of the pure doctrine of Lucifer brought finally out into public view. A manifestation which will result from a general reactionary movement which will follow the destruction of Christianity and Atheism; both conquered and exterminated at the same time.

1,God can be whatever or whomever. Hey we have santa clause the easter bunny. So who says their not real
0,"Let me answer your questions in reverse.
Is God real?---my answer is ""yes"", I think so""---and I think that for numerous reasons.
Many will say ""no"" also for numerous reasons.
Either they are right or I am right---God's existence is not contingent upon what any human thinks or believes about His existence.
Who is God?    Well, any God worthy of the name would be at least as good as the best person I know, would be all powerful, and would have every good quality I could ever imagine. (Of course, you could think he is cruel and uncaring---but who would want such a God?)
If you want to find Him, you can; and He will reveal Himself to you.
Of course, many people with disagree with me, so maybe the best thing to do is to seek Him by yourself."
1,"God or gods are real.  What they want, who knows?  Religions speculate a lot on the subject.  I believe in the Jewish/Christian/Islamic god.  That does not make me right, I just real it does.  The existence of a god is incontestable. 
St Thomas Aquinas in his 5 proofs of god described it well, either the universe has always existed, came from something else, or was created.  If you accept the first, fine.  If you accept the second, it just pushes the question backwards and is essentially a version of the first, so fine.  If you accept the third you are accepting the existence of a god.  The same arguments to be assigned to where god came from only all three point to a god so for that it is cyclic logic and therefore invalid.
The reason I consider Aquinas's arguments as valid is not where the world/universe came from but rather where did life come from.  I wrote a response discussing life elsewhere on blurt it (philosophy-religion.blurtit.com/4411070/why-do-people-believ).
The steady state theory of the universe, that is to say the theory the universe has always existed has been universally abandoned by all scientific theories. This means life could not have always existed.  Even if you accept the universe came from something else and can be pushed back infinity in time such that the matter/energy that makes up the universe has always existed, with the universe coming into existence especially as described by the Big Bang theory, life did not exist at that moment.  Therefore life came about within the universe.  As described in  my referenced article, life is not unlikely even given the trillions or more of astronomical bodies, it is not improbable, it is not near impossible, IT IS IMPOSSIBLE to occur naturally.  It required a deliberate act.
Please note that the article does not even begin to indicate the actual odds against life.  There are literally hundreds of major biochemical systems within even the simplest of living organisms.  The computations were for just one part of one system.  And as I said randomly it might be possible for any single DNA strand or RNA strand or polypeptide or any lipid or other component to be created by natural means but for all the components to be created all in the same place and at the same time in the exact ratios needed and to be enclosed and segregated such that the biochemical chain of reactions we call life could take place is impossible.
Oh and I have read the theories that life started as a short chain retro virus.  Possibly.  But a retro virus can not reproduce.  It does not have any metabolic pathways.  It depends solely upon the pathways of what ever LIVING cell it enters. That requires some other complete system.  Maybe the retro virus did come first, but it was not alive (depending on your definition of living, it is not alive as it cannot reproduce) until the living cell was subsequently appeared.  Under natural circumstances a single retro virus without any form of host will eventually be broken down.
There is a god or gods.  They may or may not care about us.  They may or may not even know we exist, life itself may be some unnoticed side affect of something they did eons ago.  If life on the earth is deliberate, we may actually be nothing more than a petri dish for making a vaccine or biological weapon.  As to whether any god desires worship, we cannot really know only think and/or believe.  As to whether any god has established rules for our lives, the same. 
I choose to believe that a least one god ""created"" us deliberately and that it cares what happens to us.  How you choose to view the gods is your choice, but I consider you are probably ignorant of biology and biochemistry if you consider life as occurring completely naturally."

Is God real?? - What is Real? What is perceived to be based on our worldview of reality? If so, would Santa Claus be real to a 4 year old whom was indoctrinated to believe so? The idea of free presents given by an Omnipresent man made from his magical elves, is enough for any simple minded child to create many confirmation biases to keep the illusion alive. Is it any wonder why the scriptures call for believers to be ""Child like in their faith""?"
0,"Just want to add this. My nephew before he turned 1 year old always referred to his mother by saying ma or maam!! Baby speech. Of course he can't talk yet. My question is, how did he know that's his mom ? No one ever told him and for sure no one ever called his mother that."

 If I watch TV it tends to be along the lines of David Attenborough, humans living in diverse settings or history. What have I learned? That mankind is unnatural in its way, and destructive, we wasn't always so. That tribes live long lives without western medicine, for they have lived in harmony with the spirit of nature. It hasn't been western society teaching tribal culture how to cure but the other way round. Much of our sickness is due to living in close proximity and the state of our food source.  
As for religious texts many point to Sumer the first civilisation whether they have created many gods or used all those god traits in one. Why did we settle and create elaborate buildings and sewage systems? Domesticate cattle and wild grass, create a banking system? All that has ended us here. Wherever we are so is concrete, toxins and poverty. Why would nomad tribes who lived in harmony with the land for thousands of years, choose to settle when common sense told them that creating a surplus food supply makes it vulnerable to control? Whoever controls the food source controls everyone. People talk about religious ideas brainwashing man, many ideas brainwash man besides religion. If they didn't we certainly wouldn't be working at least 40 hours a week, or being fined for rules we did not make. Common law says you ""must not harm your neighbour."" Yet here we are bogged down with statutes and contract law of which none follow that common law, they are there to make our corporations money and everything is a corporation a legal entity.  Still they have enslaved and examined human interaction for years.
 Bill Gates is for vaccination to control the population. Their intent has always been create conflict through polarity, create the solution once society has had enough and has no where else to turn. Then society remains loyal to their masters. Put Christian up against Muslim, Atheist up against Theist and Republican up against Democrat. The result is the same totalitarianism masked as choice.

We shall unleash the nihilists and the atheists and we shall provoke a great social cataclysm which in all its horror will show clearly to all nations the effect of absolute atheism; the origins of savagery and of most bloody turmoil.Then everywhere, the people will be forced to defend themselves against the world minority of the world revolutionaries and will exterminate those destroyers of civilization and the multitudes disillusioned with Christianity whose spirits will be from that moment without direction and leadership and anxious for an ideal, but without knowledge where to send its adoration, will receive the true light through the universal manifestation of the pure doctrine of Lucifer brought finally out into public view. A manifestation which will result from a general reactionary movement which will follow the destruction of Christianity and Atheism; both conquered and exterminated at the same time.

1,God can be whatever or whomever. Hey we have santa clause the easter bunny. So who says their not real
0,"Let me answer your questions in reverse.
Is God real?---my answer is ""yes"", I think so""---and I think that for numerous reasons.
Many will say ""no"" also for numerous reasons.
Either they are right or I am right---God's existence is not contingent upon what any human thinks or believes about His existence.
Who is God?    Well, any God worthy of the name would be at least as good as the best person I know, would be all powerful, and would have every good quality I could ever imagine. (Of course, you could think he is cruel and uncaring---but who would want such a God?)
If you want to find Him, you can; and He will reveal Himself to you.
Of course, many people with disagree with me, so maybe the best thing to do is to seek Him by yourself."
1,"God or gods are real.  What they want, who knows?  Religions speculate a lot on the subject.  I believe in the Jewish/Christian/Islamic god.  That does not make me right, I just real it does.  The existence of a god is incontestable. 
St Thomas Aquinas in his 5 proofs of god described it well, either the universe has always existed, came from something else, or was created.  If you accept the first, fine.  If you accept the second, it just pushes the question backwards and is essentially a version of the first, so fine.  If you accept the third you are accepting the existence of a god.  The same arguments to be assigned to where god came from only all three point to a god so for that it is cyclic logic and therefore invalid.
The reason I consider Aquinas's arguments as valid is not where the world/universe came from but rather where did life come from.  I wrote a response discussing life elsewhere on blurt it (philosophy-religion.blurtit.com/4411070/why-do-people-believ).
The steady state theory of the universe, that is to say the theory the universe has always existed has been universally abandoned by all scientific theories. This means life could not have always existed.  Even if you accept the universe came from something else and can be pushed back infinity in time such that the matter/energy that makes up the universe has always existed, with the universe coming into existence especially as described by the Big Bang theory, life did not exist at that moment.  Therefore life came about within the universe.  As described in  my referenced article, life is not unlikely even given the trillions or more of astronomical bodies, it is not improbable, it is not near impossible, IT IS IMPOSSIBLE to occur naturally.  It required a deliberate act.
Please note that the article does not even begin to indicate the actual odds against life.  There are literally hundreds of major biochemical systems within even the simplest of living organisms.  The computations were for just one part of one system.  And as I said randomly it might be possible for any single DNA strand or RNA strand or polypeptide or any lipid or other component to be created by natural means but for all the components to be created all in the same place and at the same time in the exact ratios needed and to be enclosed and segregated such that the biochemical chain of reactions we call life could take place is impossible.
Oh and I have read the theories that life started as a short chain retro virus.  Possibly.  But a retro virus can not reproduce.  It does not have any metabolic pathways.  It depends solely upon the pathways of what ever LIVING cell it enters. That requires some other complete system.  Maybe the retro virus did come first, but it was not alive (depending on your definition of living, it is not alive as it cannot reproduce) until the living cell was subsequently appeared.  Under natural circumstances a single retro virus without any form of host will eventually be broken down.
There is a god or gods.  They may or may not care about us.  They may or may not even know we exist, life itself may be some unnoticed side affect of something they did eons ago.  If life on the earth is deliberate, we may actually be nothing more than a petri dish for making a vaccine or biological weapon.  As to whether any god desires worship, we cannot really know only think and/or believe.  As to whether any god has established rules for our lives, the same. 
I choose to believe that a least one god ""created"" us deliberately and that it cares what happens to us.  How you choose to view the gods is your choice, but I consider you are probably ignorant of biology and biochemistry if you consider life as occurring completely naturally."

0,"Depends on the answer to the following question.

""How old are you?""

If you are under a certain age, with religious parents who fearfully indoctrinate the only people gullible enough to accept the nonsense they peddle in a desperate attempt to ensure the next generation keeps making the same mistakes? I'm not going to tell you the truth. Go ahead and keep believing in a daddy god. Sweetie.

If you are over a certain, age, then you need to get over it. There is no god."
1,"How do you really know that God is real? How do you know somebody
didn't just make Him up so we'd all feel better, and then passed that
information down to us? What if we made up God to feel less alone?""
These
are really good questions and we have answers for them. But questions
like these strike fear into the hearts of most parents, so we react with
the holy sounding dodge: ""Um, well, we just have to believe. The Bible
says blessed are those who have not seen and yet still believe."""
